<p>Valentine recently found himself in Africa for two weeks to follow up on his <a href="https://www.thrasherresearch.org/grant/01282?lang=eng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prevention of Developmental Delay and Xylitol (PDDaX) trial</a> in Malawi and develop a neurodevelopmental program that evaluates early nutritional practices for small and sick newborns in Ethiopia. </p>
<p>“What really hits me hard is when I go abroad, I see significant health disparities in the units, and I see babies dying from preventable diseases,” said Valentine. “Seeing a baby die from an entirely preventable cause of death is my motivation that drives me to figure out how I can prevent that from ever occurring again to any other baby.”</p>
<p>Valentine, a neonatologist at UW Medicine and Seattle Children’s Hospital, discovered his passion for pediatrics while studying abroad as an undergraduate at Baylor University.</p>
<p>“I remember leaving the orphanage in Romania and telling them I would come back, and they said that everyone always says they’re coming back but nobody ever does,” said Valentine. “It really just hit me that these orphans had these feelings of abandonment get reinforced every year, so from that point on I knew I was drawn to pediatrics and global health.”</p>
<p>Valentine gravitated towards neonatology while attending medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.</p>
<p>He returned to Romania for one year during his Pediatrics and Global Child Health Residency at Baylor College of Medicine to work at an infectious disease hospital and help local orphans.</p>
<p>This work exposed Valentine to the procedural role of an intensive care physician and solidified his desire to work in neonatology.</p>
<p>“Small and sick premature babies have no say in where they are born or any issues that occur to them, so they are truly the most vulnerable population that really depend on us to care for them,” explained Valentine. “A baby that is born in the U.S. is more likely to survive than a baby that is born in a low-resourced setting and I don’t think that is how it should be.”</p>
<p>Valentine’s work at the UW includes teaching as an adjunct Associate Professor at the UW School of Dentistry and UW Department of Mechanical Engineering, serving on the Executive Advisory Board for the Engineering Innovation in Health (EIH) program and co-leading ALIGN (Advanced Learning and Innovation in Global Neonatology) within the Division of Neonatology at UW Medicine.</p>
<p>In addition to his regional work, Valentine has served as a consultant with the World Health Organization and is currently collaborating on several publications aimed at improving small and sick newborn care and quality indicators.</p>
<p>“All of these hats that I wear distill down to improving the care for small and sick newborns,” said Valentine. “The dental work is related to improving oral health in pregnancy that prevents preterm birth and the engineering work is about how to improve access to care and make healthcare more affordable in low-resourced settings.”</p>
<p>Valentine has engaged with the University of Washington Population Health Initiative at several key junctures in his work, including leading a Tier 2 pilot grant and mentoring graduate students in the Social Entrepreneurship Fellowship program.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/2024/04/01/initiative-awards-six-proof-of-concept-grants-to-interdisciplinary-teams-of-uw-researchers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tier 2 pilot grant</a> looks to expand on previous research by evaluating the effects of xylitol-containing chewing gum on the microbiome and inflammatory changes within gingival tissues of pregnant individuals in Malawi.</p>
<p>“In evaluating the mechanism of action for Xylitol through either a microbiome or an inflammatory effect … there is potential for a revolutionary change to how we improve and overcome health disparities related to premature birth,” said Valentine.</p>
<p>Through the Population Health Initiative <a href="https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/education-and-training/social-entrepreneurship-fellowship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Social Entrepreneurship Fellowship program</a>, Valentine and his colleague Dr. <a href="https://uwpediatrics.org/directory/krystle_perez/1770" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Krystle Perez</a> worked with two graduate fellows to develop an innovative IV skin patch and an affordable, portable device for blood pH measurement.</p>
<p>Both projects aim to provide life-saving medical tools to medical providers in low-resourced settings and eliminate the financial barriers associated with maternal and neonatal healthcare.</p>
<p>“We can’t always prevent preterm birth, so for those babies that are born preterm there are already overworked and overburdened nurses that have limited resources,” explained Valentine. “In trying to make healthcare more affordable and accessible, it’s integral to develop innovations that can help those overburdened nurses care for these small and sick newborns.”</p>
<p>He emphasized the importance of funding opportunities like the UW Population Health Initiative and their ability to illuminate solutions towards systemic change.</p>
<p>“Without having opportunities to gather preliminary data with the Population Health Initiative, my group and others would not be successful in receiving larger grants that could advance the quality of care for pregnant people and their children worldwide,” explained Valentine.“The PHI grants really provide the opportunity to overcome preterm birth health disparities that many other grants cannot.”</p>
<p>As Valentine continues to work for systemic change in overcoming health disparities among newborns around the world, he reiterated the power of teamwork in making his dream a reality.</p>
<p>“One of the best parts of my job is collaborating with leaders in maternal and newborn health throughout the world,” said Valentine. “I find myself as more of a team developer, a collaborator, a networker. Having a great team of passionate, driven leaders is needed to overcome and devise novel solutions to pressing clinical problems, and we are fortunate to be at a world-renowned university where these connections can be easily made.”</p>

<h2 class="js-accordion__header">Leveraging a Community-based Participatory Research approach for a Qualitative Study Exploring the Methamphetamine Use Continuum among Cisgender Men and Transgender People who Have Sex with Men</h2>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong><br />
Arjee J. Restar, Department of Epidemiology<br />
Christopher Archiopoli, Peer Seattle<br />
Mike Barry, Department of Epidemiology<br />
Peter Cleary, Project NEON, Seattle’s LGBTQ Center (formerly Gay City Health Project)<br />
Kristin Beima-Sofie, Department of Global Health<br />
Jane J. Lee, School of Social Work</p>
<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
This project’s proposed aims were to (1) explore facilitators, contextual experiences, and patterns of methamphetamine (MA) use among cisgender men and transgender people who have sex with men (MTSM) through qualitative interviews (N=40) and (2) generate an MA use continuum framework for later use in the development of a quantitative, population-level study instrument.  </p>
<p>In the corresponding evaluation plan, we identified two markers of success in our work: (1) the inclusion of &gt;20 transgender individuals in our study and (2) the effective, active inclusion of our community partner agencies throughout the research work.   </p>
<p>At the conclusion of data collection (August 2023), we had interviewed 49 individual MTSM with a history of MA use, including 20 transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming (gender diverse) individuals. The findings of this work can be successfully translated to the development of a quantitative instrument that measures MA trajectories and associated risk factors in a large sample. </p>

<p><strong>Investigators</strong><br />
Jianzhao Bi, Department of Environmental &amp; Occupational Health Sciences<br />
Joel Kaufman, Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology<br />
Adam Szpiro, Department of Biostatistics<br />
Nicole Errett, Department of Environmental &amp; Occupational Health Sciences<br />

<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
The project aimed to address the lack of accurate exposure estimates for wildfire smoke PM2.5 and develop a proof-of-concept framework for high-resolution wildfire PM2.5 estimation in Washington, with an ultimate goal of expanding it to cover the entire US in future projects. </p>
<p>In this pilot project, we developed a prototype machine learning framework based on the Random Forest algorithm. The framework has demonstrated its ability to effectively incorporate multiple data sources into wildfire PM2.5 prediction, including satellite, low-cost sensors, high-resolution meteorology and a comprehensive set of geographic covariates. The framework form the solid foundation for our subsequent wildfire PM2.5 modeling analysis. We organized and rigorously tested high-performance computing resources, ensuring that our modeling analysis can be efficiently executed. These developments highlight the project’s alignment with the original research and evaluation strategy, which ultimately aims to enhance the accuracy of epidemiological analyses and advancing early warning systems for severe smoke episodes.</p>
<p>Notably, the preliminary outcomes from this pilot grant have already facilitated the applications of two larger grants. One is the ECHO AWARE initiative funded by NIH, and another is an NIEHS K99/R00 grant with a fundable score. These achievements underscore the invaluable role of the pilot grant in laying the statistical groundwork, validating exposure assessment methodologies and providing crucial insights that have contributed to the success and expansion of our research endeavors.</p>

<h2 class="js-accordion__header">Evaluating a community-based doula program to inform upcoming expansion of doula care under Medicaid in Washington: a mixed-methods, community informed approach</h2>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong><br />

<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
Community-based doulas, who provide informational, physical, and emotional perinatal support and are from the same communities of the families they serve, are increasingly recognized as a strategy to improve perinatal health and health inequities. However, little is known about successful implementation and sustainability of community-based doula programs. Therefore, the goals of this project were to conduct a mixed-methods study to examine the implementation and health outcomes of a community-based doula program serving low-income families and the barriers and facilitators that influenced these outcomes. This project was conceptualized and implemented by a collaborative academic-research team including Open Arms Perinatal Services and social epidemiologists at the University of Washington. </p>
<p>We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods design (quan-&gt;QUAL) with programmatic data and focus groups with community-based direct service providers. First, we analyzed programmatic data, including time spent with families and health outcomes, among all families enrolled in the program from January 2016-December 2022. Then, building on these quantitative findings, we conducted four in-depth focus groups with the program’s direct service providers. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Additionally, we had a member checking event where we shared and discussed the preliminary mixed-methods findings with participants in order to validate these findings.  </p>
<p>Results indicated community-based doulas provide extensive support to the families they serve during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and postpartum. Among the over 2,000 families served, there were 14,672 total home visits that totaled 17,774 hours. Over $87,000 in direct funds and 7,000 tangible items (e.g. diapers) were dispersed to families. Preterm birth ranged from 4-9% across programs and the vast majority (&gt;94%) were lactating at birth. Direct service providers identified holistic, culturally-matched services and “doula-ing the doula” (organizational infrastructure to support doula’s work) as facilitators. Barriers included the intersecting systems of oppression that underlie the primary challenges faced by direct service providers, including lack of community resources and power asymmetries within birth settings, that can lead to provider burnout. These findings document the positive impact of community-based doulas and bolsters the calls for their increased compensation and structural supports. </p>

Allison Cole, Department of Family Medicine</p>
<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
The goal of this study was to identify socioeconomic factors associated with cervical cancer under-screening by screening modalities in a national sample of commercially insured population in the United States (US). We used a nationally representative anonymized longitudinal administrative claims dataset called Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart, which contains all claims (e.g., verified, adjudicated, adjusted, and denied) for approximately 13 million annual covered lives.1 During the award period, we successfully worked with the University of Southern California (USC) Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics to establish the Optum Data License Agreement and access to the de-identified, limited data set through the shared secure network terminal at USC.</p>
<p>We used Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart from 2012-2021 to identify individuals aged 30-64 to examine over and under-screening to understand national patterns of guideline adherence. Average-risk females with continuous enrollment for six years for years starting in 2013-2017 and at least one claim were included. Those with a history of hysterectomy and/or cervical cancer were excluded. According to the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force guideline, adherence was defined as a screening interval of 4.5-5.5 years for co-testing/HPV testing as the index screening modality and 2.5-3.5 years for cytology-only, and over-screening as &lt;4.5 years and 5.5 years and &gt;3.5 years including lack of subsequent screening, respectively. We compared the distribution of screening adherence by screening modality, race, education level and household net worth using chi-squared test.</p>
<p>A total of 1,422,258 individuals ages 30-64 were included in the analysis. Among the eligible sample, 1,016,067 individuals received at least one cervical cancer screening from 2013-2017. Only 7.4% received guideline-adherent cervical cancer screening in this nationally representative sample of commercially insured females. Over- and under-screening varied significantly by screening modalities, race, education level and household net worth, indicating the need for tailored strategies while ensuring equity. Our study demonstrated that more research is needed to ensure that guideline changes, introduction of screening modalities, and de-implementation of cytology do not exacerbate existing disparities. The findings can inform policies for incentives that address over-screening and under-screening to eliminate cervical cancer disparities in the US.</p>

<h2 class="js-accordion__header">Conducting a needs and capacity assessment with midwives in rural Bangladesh to develop a tailored mental health promotion curriculum for Bangladeshi women during the perinatal period</h2>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong><br />
Annika Sahota, Mental Health Matters of Washington<br />
Jody Early, UW Bothell School of Nursing &amp; Health Studies<br />
Iftikher Mahmood, Hope Foundation for Women and Children of Bangladesh</p>
<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
Bangladesh presents a unique atmosphere because they have made significant strides as a nation to achieve maternal and child health objectives; yet, perinatal mental health care remains to be essentially non-existent. This is ultimately due to a lack of infrastructure and investment in psychological wellbeing. The aim of this project, in collaboration with the HOPE Foundation for Women and Children of Bangladesh, was to begin building the foundation for improving perinatal mental health promotion across all socio-ecological levels.</p>
<p>While conducting our preliminary assessments, three areas of work emerged: 1) clinical procedures and protocols 2) midwifery training and 3) social impact. Conversations were held with HOPE employees with various roles as well as with partner NGOs (specifically within refugee camps), and patient families to become more knowledgeable about current clinical processes for detecting, preventing and treating psychological challenges during pregnancy within HOPE patient populations. Through these conversations we learned that a single clinical psychologist serves all HOPE facilities and an external psychiatrist visits the field hospital once a month to provide care. Furthermore, we learned that mental health evaluations are not standardized practices. We also learned that collection of patient history and communication between providers typically does not occur unless specifically requested by the psychologist or psychiatrist. </p>
<p>It must be noted that the HOPE Foundation has created a guideline for post-delivery mental health visits, but the barrier to perinatal mental health care is ensuring these guidelines are implemented. These guidelines indicate that mental health visits should occur 5 days, 14 days, 28 days, and 3 months after delivery. The clinical psychologist informed us that patients are advised to attend these mental health check-in appointments at the discretion of their provider (e.g., physician, midwife, etc.). This ultimately leads to many perinatal mental health conditions going undetected as the vast majority of healthcare providers at the HOPE Foundation do not have foundation training in mental health care. </p>
<p>Due to the combination of these factors, only 30% of high risk patients attend the first appointment, 5 days postpartum. Approximately 35% of the patient population will skip at least one appointment but attend at least one of the later appointments. Lastly, of those who do no attend any appointment, approximately 50% of this population express suicidal ideation some point postpartum. Factors influencing a patient’s attendance are believed to be directly correlated with the severity of mental state. For instance, an individual’s mental wellbeing has deteriorated to such a point that they no longer care about the social stigma. Additionally, patients who attended follow-up mental health appointments from the start typically expressed having greater familial support and recognition of psychological wellbeing. Through our evaluation a few recommendations we have suggested are: administration of institutional questionnaire to all patients– regardless of appointment type, integration of mental health check-ins with newborn check-ups, improving connection and communication among providers, and investing in the clinical psychologist by providing supplemental training opportunities.</p>
<p>While evaluating the midwifery training program offered by the HOPE Foundation through evaluation of the curriculum and scoping conversations with students we learned there is a significant gap in the midwifery education. Currently midwifery students have little to no formal knowledge or training in mental health issues. This is a systemic problem as the midwifery curriculum is determined at the governmental level, meaning all institutes must provide the same courses and training without modification. One potential ‘loophole’ to this rule to begin implementing change internally prior to obtaining governmental approval is to classify perinatal mental health specific training as an extracurricular activity.</p>
<p>Finally, while examining behaviors and perceptions towards mental health from the community level to an individual level we learned there is a lack of awareness among patients about maternal health, specifically mental health care. Other social factors impacting access to effective care include early and child marriages, Islamic beliefs, use of traditional birthing practices, and biological sex preference of fetus / neonate. Moreover, mother-in-law and husband-related stressors were identified as leading causes of mental health issues among women.</p>

<h2 class="js-accordion__header">Self-employment, well-being, and the social determinants of health: an exploratory study of microenterprise home kitchen operations in California and Washington</h2>
<p><strong>Investigators</strong><br />
Will von Geldern, Evans School of Public Policy &amp; Governance<br />
Anjum Hajat, Department of Epidemiology<br />
Heather Hill, Evans School of Public Policy &amp; Governance</p>
<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
This project team sought to understand how entrepreneurs perceive the effects of self-employment on their mental health and social determinants of health such as financial security, social capital and health care access. We also hoped to elucidate the decision-making processes of self-employed individuals from marginalized communities to better inform future policymaking in this area.</p>
<p>We completed 37 interviews with active home-based food business owners recruited through community partners in San Diego and Seattle. After completing approximately half of our anticipated interviews, we began coding interview data through an iterative and collaborative process. Collaborative coding of several transcripts enabled the development of a codebook, and codes were subsequently applied to all 36 valid interview transcripts. We then met to discuss potential themes for manuscript development.</p>
<p>Initially, we had planned to focus our analysis on several potential topics including the perceived effects of self-employment on mental health and social determinants of health and the importance of formal home kitchen permits to health outcomes and social determinants. Our discussions, the content of interviews, and additional reading led us to focus instead on precarious employment as a framework for understanding the self-employment experiences of study participants. Precarious employment is a multidimensional concept which scholars have used to assess employer-worker relationships, and which has been consistently connected with adverse health outcomes.</p>
<p>Many low-income workers in the United States face significant health-related consequences as a result of precarious employment relationships. Our analysis identified some ways in which self-employment aligned with experiences of precarious employment and other ways in which self-employment seemed to be very different. Existing research has not thoroughly described how self-employment in marginalized communities differs from other employment opportunities, and how this relates to mental and physical health outcomes. We believe our data could help identify mechanisms underlying the precarity (and benefits) of self-employment and contribute to further research in this area.</p>
<p>We will present early findings of our analysis using a precarious employment framework at the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management (APPAM) conference in November 2023. These findings suggest that self-employment helped mitigate or eliminate some adverse experiences associated with precarious employment such as unpredictable work schedules, social isolation and physically damaging working conditions. The ability to work from home was also a widely-noted benefit of self-employment within our unique sample. On the other hand, participants referenced common experiences of precarious employment such as low and unstable incomes, long hours and multiple jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
Climate-sensitive hazards can jeopardize the health of all populations. However, certain population groups are more vulnerable to health and well-being effects from these hazards (e.g., from extreme heat). While youth, particularly those from historically marginalized groups and communities, are one of the populations at the highest risk, their abilities may be underutilized in local climate adaptation efforts. This exploratory research: </p>
<ol>
<li>Investigated youth risk perceptions and impacts of various climate-sensitive hazards (e.g., wildfire smoke, flooding, rising sea levels, and extreme heat)</li>
<li>Explored spaces where youth and community leaders can support youth-led climate-related initiatives</li>
<li>Examined current barriers, resource needs and opportunities for young folks to engage in climate and environmental solution work</li>
</ol>
<p>Through focus group discussions with youth and in-depth interviews with community youth leaders, this study identified opportunities to leverage youth experiences, perceptions and assets to promote a healthy and resilient community in the face of various compounding climate-related threats. While youth recognize the shifting climate and have become motivated to address such justice issues, barriers like limited financial capacity and political support impact their long-term participation. Findings suggest multiple benefits of supporting youth integration into climate adaptation efforts as they can: </p>
<ol>
<li>Illuminate nuances of climate and health dynamics impacting community members</li>
<li>Create avenues for increasing outreach and education</li>
<li>Build community capacity through climate actions and advocacy work</li>

<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
The goal of this project was to lay a foundation for a human centered design-trained hub within the government’s Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC) to lead initiatives that leverage HCD methods to create context-appropriate, community-informed solutions to priority nutrition issues.</p>
<p>The UW team completed a literature review of applications of design to improve health outcomes in LMICs. We conducted this literature review during the Winter 2023 quarter with a team of UW students across the Department of Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering and School of Public Health. We pursued this literature review to inform content and strategy of the TFNC workshop curriculum. Our landscaping includes 127 articles from human computer interaction (HCI) and health publications, and identifies trends in geographic representation, health topics, artifacts designed, users, design methods, and scale up/sustainability plans across all articles and disaggregated by publication type. Beyond helping us identify guest speakers and relevant examples for the workshop, this activity fills a global knowledge gap on how HCD has been used for health projects in LMICs. We intend to submit two papers for peer-review; one paper will be drafted for a global health audience and one paper focused on technology-related innovations will be drafted for a HCI audience.</p>
<p>We integrated findings from the literature review, consultations with global health professionals that have conducted HCD workshops, existing HCD curriculum, and TFNC’s priorities to develop curriculum for a HCD workshop in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The workshop aims: (1) Learn basics of applying the design process to encourage innovative solutions using Tanzania nutrition issues as case studies; (2) Collaborate with team members to develop project ideas into concept notes; and (3) Expand collaboration between TFNC and HCDE. The workshop aimed to generate concept notes for projects that integrate HCD methods on three priority TFNC topics (exclusive breastfeeding, transition from exclusive breastfeeding to complementary feeding, and care-seeking for children with severe acute malnutrition). TFNC selected workshop participants by advertising the training opportunity to staff and reviewing application essays outlining what applicants hoped to get out of the training. At the end of the workshop, each of the three groups presented concept note outlines, which described the nutrition problem, identified research and design questions, and proposed methods for data collection and analysis. </p>

Ariana Anjaz, Afghan Health Initiative</p>
<p><strong>Project summary</strong><br />
The primary goals of this project was to identify the facilitators and barriers to improve practices of Afghan refugees during pregnancy including seeking prenatal care services and opting for hospital births. This project worked with the only Afghan-led community-based organization in Washington state to conduct focus groups with Afghan refugees (men and women) and to discuss findings and next steps with community members at a community townhall. The focus groups identified lack of transportation, lack of social support, husband’s work schedules, insurance coverage and long waiting periods for appointments as primary barriers to seeking prenatal care services and opting-in for hospital births. Participants described social support (e.g. home visits by healthcare staff), husband’s involvement and healthcare professionals with clear and welcoming communication are all facilitators to their healthcare seeking behavior during pregnancy.  </p>
<p>The PI and the leadership of AHI have met to discuss interests in presenting the findings in peer-reviewed manuscripts and at public health professional meetings. We also plan to share the findings with other refugee-serving organizations in King County with the goal of co-developing proposals for better serving refugees based on common needs and challenges community members share across organizations. We also plan to convene early 2025 to apply for additional funding to expand the scope of the project.  </p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Early identification of neurodevelopmental delay (NDD) and timely referral to developmental therapies can prevent or lessen the severity of NDD among children. Yet, only 50% of newborns identified at high risk for NDD follow-up for scheduled neurodevelopmental care visits. It is unclear why certain families follow up for care and others do not. The Institute of Human Development &amp; Disability (IHDD) is a leader in the care for high-risk children and is the leading comprehensive neurodevelopmental care center in Washington State for infants with NDD. </p>
<p>Collaborating with the Washington State Department of Health and the Washington State Perinatal Collaborative, we will conduct key informant interviews care with 15-25 families (proceeding to saturation) at two time points: (a) 6 months corrected gestational age (CGA), and (b) 12 months CGA. We will sample families who received follow-up with IHDD and those who were referred but did not attend a follow up visit. We will determine facilitators and barriers to attend neurodevelopmental follow-up care. In addition, we will perform chart reviews of 100 families (n=50 families who attended follow-up and 50 who did not) evaluating demographic, socioeconomic and other factors to determine quantitatively (via generalized linear models) significant factors associated with becoming lost to follow-up. </p>
<p>The results will facilitate the development of targeted and likely innovative, alternative methods (e.g. remote neurodevelopmental assessments) seeking to overcome barriers of high-risk children following up for neurodevelopmental care. These results will facilitate future follow-on funding opportunities to address and overcome this critical public health disparity.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Penicillin allergies are reported by 10-20% of all people, but &gt;90% of penicillin allergy labels are disproved after formal allergy testing. Inaccurate or unverified antibiotic allergies are associated with worse outcomes including suboptimal treatment of infections, increased antimicrobial resistance, and higher healthcare costs. Antibiotic allergy de-labeling is a cost-effective intervention aligned with global and public health goals of antimicrobial stewardship. Although penicillin allergy evaluation programs have proven successful in identifying low-risk individuals for de-labeling in ambulatory settings, antibiotic allergy testing remains not widely available and most reported drug allergies remain unverified.</p>
<p>To date, antibiotic allergy de-labeling efforts have not prioritized health equity. Individuals who currently receive allergy specialist evaluations for drug allergies are predominantly non-Hispanic, educated, and healthy. Equitable access to antibiotic allergy testing is critical to minimize adverse health outcomes, particularly within infectious disease care. To address these gaps, we propose to quantify trends and inequities related to antibiotic allergy labeling and access to antibiotic allergy testing for clients served by the University of Washington and affiliated King County Public Health Centers, and to qualitatively identify determinants that may influence a future implementation of task-sharing antibiotic allergy evaluations with non-allergist providers. </p>
<p>Results from this study will lay the foundation for future pilot intervention strategy that can be tested in various settings, and prioritizing patient populations most likely to benefit from antibiotic allergy de-labeling. This work directly aligns with national professional society (AAAAI, IDSA) and CDC priorities and the overarching goals of improving human health and social and economic equity.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Individuals with serious cardiac illness (SCI) in the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WWAMI) region must travel to Seattle when they need advanced therapies. The University of Washington (UW) Medical Center is the only major hospital system to offer heart transplants and other advanced therapies in this region, which covers more than 1/5 of the land mass of the United States. This is a regional population health challenge because it presents difficulties for patients (and their family members/caregivers), and there is currently no forum to engage patients about their care experiences or to assess priorities for research regarding care delivery solutions. To address this challenge, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical and community engaged research. </p>
<p>This proposal aims to explore the needs, preferences and priorities of patients, family members/caregivers and health care team members about participating in community engaged research and to identify research priorities as a first step in developing a community advisory board focused on SCI in the WWAMI region. This addresses the population health pillars of human health and social and economic equity. We will hold a series of workshops informed by user-centered design, then conduct a mixed-methods analysis of findings. Anticipated deliverables are 1) a coproduced structure for future community engaged WWAMI SCI research; 2) identification of priority research topics; and 3) determination of next steps (timeline and potential funding sources).</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Firearms are the leading cause of death among children and adolescents aged 1-19 years in the U.S.; this crisis disproportionately impacts Black, Indigenous, and other Communities of Color, as well as those facing economic and social inequities. Secure firearm storage (SFS) is a harm reduction strategy seeking to address this crisis. Social workers — the largest group of mental health providers in the country — currently have limited access to training in SFS counseling.</p>
<p>This proposal leverages interdisciplinary expertise in epidemiology and social work to adapt existing SFS trainings for the social work context and pilot a training program for Washington state social workers, enhancing their ability to counsel caregivers on SFS. In Aim 1, we will conduct in-depth interviews with social workers experienced in SFS counseling with racially, geographically, and socioeconomically diverse families. Participants will provide case examples from their experiences counseling families about SFS, suggest adaptations to existing trainings and offer feedback on competencies to measure training effectiveness. In Aim 2, we will assess the pilot training’s preliminary effectiveness through pre/post surveys and simulated counseling with a standardized client. Participants (n=80-100) will be advanced year Master of Social Work students at UW and Eastern Washington University. </p>
<p>The pilot training program will directly address the PHI pillars of human health and social and economic equity by equipping social workers with the tools and knowledge to address the intersecting social, economic, and behavioral factors that influence disparities in firearm injury and violence.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
The National Osteoporosis Foundation’s update to its bone fragility prevalence data showed that an estimated 10.2 million adults in the USA have osteoporosis and another 43.4 million have osteopenia. This translates to approximately 54 million US adults, representing 50 percent of the adult population over age 50, who are at risk for a fragility fracture due to osteoporosis or osteopenia. Treating people who are at risk for fragility fractures with medications is extremely valuable using multiple metrics such as quality-of-life improvement, morbidity reduction, and economic impact at individual and healthcare system levels. </p>
<p>Despite this, patients enrolled under Medicare continue to suffer fragility fractures at a significant rate, with an annual healthcare cost estimate of $52 billion. Data show that reports about adverse reactions to osteoporosis medications in the media with regards to medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) have been followed by a reduction in the use of these medications, despite evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks for most users. The risk of MRONJ among osteoporotic patients exposed to bisphosphonates following tooth extraction ranged from 0 to 0.15 %, and for those exposed to Denosumab was 1 %. There is no data on what percentage of the susceptible population who get a prescription for an antiresorptive medication to prevent fragility fractures or re-fractures fill it initially and consistently as recommended by their physician. The purpose of our study is to look at data from the CMS and the University of Washington Medical Center to answer this question.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Overdose and poisoning deaths have become the leading causes of death in people aged 0-24 in Washington State, with the Central District being among the neighborhoods in King County with the greatest number of opioid overdose deaths. Train-the-trainer models have been increasingly utilized to distribute opioid overdose prevention education among communities. We will develop a train-the-trainer model to train Seattle University peer health educators in teaching opioid overdose prevention. These peer health educators will then use their training to guide Garfield High School students in the co-creation of effective opioid overdose prevention initiatives within their school. </p>
<p>Our intention is to use the Tier 1 period of performance to define our research design and build capacity within our community partners – Garfield High School and Seattle University – in preparation to submit a competitive application for Seattle Children’s Center for Diversity and Health Equity (CDHE) Fellows and Residents’ Health Equity Grant. Our evaluation will focus on pre and post surveys of peer health educators, measuring the effectiveness of the train-the-trainer model as well as attitudes on the effectiveness of student-led overdose prevention initiatives. The initial data will help guide further definition of research question and design, demonstrate proof of concept for our CDHE grant application and provide justification to Seattle Public Schools of the need to evaluate the impact on Garfield student participants.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
People with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) living in the US experience barriers to accessing healthcare and preventive screening, including communication barriers with healthcare providers, challenges navigating the US healthcare system, and lack of culturally tailored educational materials. People with LEP, including Chinese Americans with LEP, have lower cervical cancer screening rates than the general population, but qualitative data on specific barriers faced by Mandarin speaking Chinese people with LEP are lacking. </p>
<p>In partnership with Seattle/King County Clinic (SKCC) and International Community Health Services (ICHS), we propose a qualitative study to understand the barriers and facilitators of cervical cancer screening experienced by Mandarin-speaking Chinese people in western Washington. We will conduct interviews in Mandarin with 20-25 people with a cervix who are aged 25 to 65 years old, have Mandarin as their native language, and have LEP. The interview guide will be developed informed by the socio-context framework to capture social, cultural, and religious factors, and by Andersen’s Behavioral Model to capture individual factors. Participants will be asked about their general thoughts and knowledge about cervical cancer screening and the main barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening, including experiences with making medical appointments and requesting a medical interpreter or cultural mediator. Results will inform interventions to improve cervical cancer screening in Mandarin-speaking Chinese people with LEP that can be developed and tested in a future study supported by R21 or R03 grant funding.</p>

We will convene three UW research groups heretofore not been meaningfully connected: WWAMI* Rural Health Research Center (RHRC), Health Equity Action Lab (HEAL), and UW Bothell School of Nursing &amp; Health Studies. Recognizing the importance of collaborative teams for competitive grants, we will use this pilot project to build our research programs through two aims. </p>
<p>First, we will evaluate the impact of the Mental Health Matters (MHM) intervention, an evidence-based, community-based and bilingual intervention based in Skagit County, WA, co-developed by community partners and our team. Our interdisciplinary team will analyze two- and three-year evaluation MHM data and conduct a qualitative assessment of Peer Mental Health Navigators’ ability to promote mental health in their communities. This evaluation will strengthen scalability, guide program modifications, and support future funding. Second, we will assess the feasibility of expanding MHM throughout the WWAMI region with community partners. We will review the MHM training curriculum to identify opportunities for stronger cultural responsiveness, feasibility and cost, and will formulate an action plan for future grants. </p>
<p>These aims culminate in a co-authored manuscript and outlined grant application, developed through two structured writing retreats. Through these activities, supported by PHI Tier 1 Pilot Research Funding, we will solidify our research partnership, advance population health, and prepare for future grant applications.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
African American grandmothers raising grandchildren in skipped-generation households (consisting only of grandparents and grandchildren) experience numerous economic, social, and health-related vulnerabilities, including severe economic deprivation, legal marginalization and poor mental and physical health outcomes. Yet, few interventions designed to reduce stress and improve health among this population address three key factors that impact their well-being: financial hardship, parenting challenges, and daily stressors. </p>
<p>We propose to develop a multicomponent stress reduction intervention that increases Black kinship caregivers’ utilization of informal and formal resources (financial navigation services and resourcefulness training), knowledge and tools to address children’s developmental needs across the life course (parenting training) and strategies to decrease daily stressors unique to their families (mindfulness based stress reduction training). To develop the intervention and set the groundwork for a future feasibility study we will conduct focus groups with kinship caregivers to get their input on intervention content, intervention format (e.g., length and number of sessions), and data collection methods (e.g., biomeasures, financial assessment tools). We will develop a community advisory board (CAB) to help guide intervention development.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
The rate of suicidality (i.e., suicide ideation, nonfatal suicide, and death by suicide), on a national level, is increasing among Black youth (up to age 18) at an alarming rate compared to their non-Black counterparts, pointing to the pivotal demand to investigate the risk and protective factors associated with suicidality among Black youth. However, there is a dearth of scholarship examining Black youth suicidality with thoughtful consideration of intersectionality (i.e., interlocking systems of oppression such as racism and ableism) and the role of policy. This exploratory mixed methods project will examine Black youth suicidality through an intersectional lens to inform future policies that are more attentive to the priorities and needs of Black youth and can thereby reverse the trends in the elevated risk of suicidality in these communities. </p>
<p>In AIM I, the most impactful policies that influence the key drivers and protective factors of suicidality risk among Black youth will be identified utilizing the Delphi prioritization method with Black mental health advocates. In AIM II, the legal and statistical epidemiologic trends of select policies most salient for Black youth suicidality will be characterized by analyzing state-administered youth surveys and performing policy surveillance. This pilot study will lay the groundwork for policy advocacy and future research exploring how policy can more effectively address Black youths’ experiences with suicidality.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Early, specialized intervention before age three is associated with long-term gains in learning, communication and everyday living skills for autistic children. However, up to 60% of children with autism who would be eligible for these services are not identified on time. A major barrier to accurate autism identification is that social communication behaviors (e.g., gesture use or imitation), which are the earliest indicators of autism, vary from situation to situation across early toddlerhood – and traditional screeners that are administered only once and in one setting may be unable to capture this variability. As such, a new screening strategy sensitive to these subtle and inconsistent social communication behaviors is urgently needed. </p>
<p>This project will be the first to explore ecological momentary assessment (EMA) as a method for identifying autism in toddlers. In EMA, caregivers respond to short text-messages on their cellphone in real-time to report on their child’s social communication behaviors across various routines and settings (e.g., breakfast at home, play at park). Importantly, caregivers will report on social communication behaviors that fit their cultural expectations, as determined in our previous pilot study. Our goal is to develop EMA procedures that will be (i) practical for use by caregivers and (ii) effective for identifying autism. We will use this information to pursue funding to examine how we can expand EMA autism screening at a larger scale. Our hope is that all autistic children, regardless of background, will access the benefit of early intervention that timely identification of the condition allows.</p>

<p><strong>Project abstract</strong><br />
Many people rely on online search engines for timely and low-cost health information and advice. In 2023, almost 13 million U.S. adults reported using generative AI as their primary tool for search, a number that is projected to increase with search engines like Google and Bing adopting these technologies. While these tools offer potential benefits, their risks, particularly regarding their influence on users’ perceptions and evaluation of health misinformation online, remain underexplored. Previous studies have shown that generative AI models that power these tools are prone to inaccurate and biased results, effects that are known to disproportionately impact marginalized and underrepresented groups (Hutchinson et al. 2020; Bender et al. 2021; Caliskan et al. 2017), raising concerns of further exacerbating health inequity.</p>
<p>This study aims to build a research agenda regarding the impact of AI-powered health information-seeking tools. The research team will conduct a pilot online experiment to explore whether and how AI-generated summaries that appear in search results, particularly summaries that may be biased or contain false information, affect people’s evaluation and judgment (e.g., perceived veracity) about health (mis)information. This line of research will enable AI developers, healthcare providers, public health organizations and policymakers to improve the safe application of generative AI for people’s health information seeking and decision making. Core to this research are implications for health equity, for example, populations with limited access to professional medical resources may rely more on online health information, making the accuracy and influence of these tools vital for improving population health and reducing disparities.</p>

Falls are the primary cause of injury and a leading cause of disability, hospitalization, and death among older adults in the United States. There are significant disparities in the rate of falling by race, ethnicity, and rurality, with American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities experiencing the highest rates of falls. The high burden of falls among AI/AN communities stems from past and present injustices and structural marginalization that have created barriers to fall prevention, including limited access to exercise facilities, low levels of physical activity, and high multi-morbidity that increase fall risk, as well as a lack of culturally resonant evidence-based fall prevention programs.</p>
<p>Despite significant disparities in health, AI/AN communities are resilient and draw strength from cultural practices and traditional teachings that promote community health. Elders are a major source of Indigenous knowledge on cultural practices for health. Thus, to reduce fall-related injury in AI/AN communities, there is a critical need to engage elders to identify, adapt, and implement culturally resonant, evidence-based fall prevention strategies. Accordingly, in collaboration with the Lummi Nation Health Center, we propose to develop a plan that further builds on community strengths and health system capacity to prevent falls among Lummi Nation elders. We will conduct a falls-focused, asset-based health assessment utilizing an appreciative inquiry approach to engage elders, local community health organizations, and healthcare providers. This multi-level assessment will identify the Lummi Nation’s fall prevention needs and identify unique cultural and community strengths to address these needs, culminating in an actionable community asset plan.</p>

Roughly 2.3 million WA residents are immigrants or have at least one parent who is an immigrant. This Laying the Foundation project will build infrastructure to establish the Center for Migration Health, a collaborative hub for research and education activities to support, strengthen and sustain the health and well-being of people in Washington who have experienced international migration. The Center will leverage prior community and public health-engaged work by faculty in the UW Departments of Pediatrics and Health Systems and Population Health, and the Washington Department of Health – Refugee Health Program as a community partner, to address the Population Health Initiative pillars of human health, and social and economic equity. </p>
<p>The specific aims will be to 1) establish cross-sector partnerships across public health, health care, social service and community organizations to inform the Center’s priorities, and 2) create guiding principles to inform the development a proof of concept proposal to fund the Center. The co-Investigators will create a summary report from specific aim 1 that includes a process evaluation of the approach and a content analysis of what is learned from the listening sessions and interviews. For specific aim 2 they will utilize nominal group technique to come to consensus around guiding principles to inform a next grant proposal.</p>

Washington state leads the U.S. in apple, blueberry and cherry production, with an <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/18/11583" rel="noopener" target="_blank">estimated 100,000 documented crop workers</a> in 2021. While there is limited research on the impact of climate change induced heat and WFS events on U.S. fruit tree workers, a <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S026974912300043X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">systematic review of current evidence</a> suggests that the long-term impact of non-occupational wildfire exposure includes mental health disorders, reduced lung function, and increased mortality.</p>
<p>In spring 2024, a team of University of Washington researchers received a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/2024/05/20/initiative-awards-13-early-stage-pilot-grants-to-teams-of-interdisciplinary-uw-investigators/">Tier 1 Population Health Initiative pilot grant</a> to study the health, well-being and job-related exposure risk factors of Yakima (WA) fruit tree farm crop workers. The project seeks to understand how these multidimensional factors change following acute heat and WFS exposure events encountered throughout the work season.</p>
<p>“Tree fruit workers are especially at-risk of heat and wildfire smoke exposure, as peaks in exposure often coincide with peaks in employment and physically demanding harvest-related activities,&#8221; said <a href="https://deohs.washington.edu/pnash/john-flunker" rel="noopener" target="_blank">John Flunker</a>, co-principal investigator and postdoctoral scholar fellow in the UW’s Department of Environmental &amp; Occupational Health Sciences. &#8220;In addition, the remote outdoor work environment experienced by tree-fruit workers makes it virtually impossible to eliminate extreme heat and wildfire smoke. Instead, workers must rely on N95 respirators, varying work schedules, shortened work days, and frequent breaks to mitigate exposure.” </p>
<p>“The health effects that we will likely note from these high exposure outdoor worker groups are transferable to regional populations. Acute health effects among high exposure worker groups may be similar to those experienced by members of the community who do not have access to clean or cool air,” added Flunker.</p>
<p>The project involves observing and assessing acute and cumulative changes to the health, well-being and job-related factors of a cohort of crop workers following heat and WFS exposure events. The crop workers will be evaluated at multiple time points during their harvest season by an initial baseline questionnaire and self-reported measurement of respiratory- and heat-related illness symptoms, changes in work practice and behaviors during smoke events, work availability and hours worked, use of personal protective equipment and mental health. </p>
<p>“One aspect of the study that we were interested in focusing on was how the Washington State permanent heat and wildfire exposure rules were impacting the safety practices of the workplace and potentially worker exposures and health effects,” shared Flunker. “Considering how personal perceptions of risk and safety practices are impacted by workplace safety protocols gives us a better understanding of the risk of exposure and ultimately risk of adverse health effects.”</p>
<p>“There is a call to action across the country that we need regulations to protect workers from environmental exposures, and Washington is leading the forefront there and creating these heat and wildfire smoke rules,” shared <a href="https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/coralynn-sack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coralynn Sack</a>, co-principal investigator and occupational medical physician and pulmonologist in the UW’s Departments of Pulmonology and Environmental &amp; Occupational Health. “This research is particularly impactful because it shows if the legislation that does exist is effective and reduces health symptoms.”</p>
<p>The project’s measures of success rely on the successful completion of its aims, with an emphasis on laying a foundation for proof-of-concept that can be communicated to key stakeholders and encourage greater interest in related research.</p>
<p>Flunker and Sack’s research team hopes to utilize the measures from their study to move into the proof-of-concept phase and gather additional funding from national institutions like Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a>. These funds would help expand research to other regions of Washington state and the U.S., creating a more comprehensive understanding of the impact that climate change related events have on the general population.</p>
<p>“The plan has always been to expand to other counties in Washington and also potentially to other areas throughout the United States so that we can really begin to get a holistic understanding of how these singular and co-exposure events are impacting workers and the communities in which they reside,” said Flunker. “Our research relies on critical partnerships with growers, workers, and community members to generate practical and impactful research. Ultimately, our goal is to help workers and their communities to live healthier, happier lives.”</p>

A few humans have also died from bird flu infection.</p>
<p>Federal health officials have deemed the Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 a low risk to public health despite four humans contracting the virus, with the most recently confirmed case experiencing flu-like respiratory symptoms. </p>
<p>UW News spoke with Peter Rabinowitz, University of Washington professor of environmental &amp; occupational health sciences and of family medicine, and Julianne Meisner, assistant professor of epidemiology and of global health, to learn more about what is causing this bird flu virus to spread from animals to humans and how its transmission could impact the health of humans and our ecosystems.</p>
