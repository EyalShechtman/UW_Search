More Advice from Undergraduate Researchers
Build Your Base


Before jumping into a research project, it&#039;s worthwhile to build your knowledge base. Read literature in your chosen field and seek out papers from prospective research groups. This will help you develop a foundational understanding of cutting-edge work, gain transferable skills, and ace your interview with potential research mentors.

But how do you read highly technical papers written for an audience of experts when you have little experience? Where do you find credible research papers in the first place? The UW Libraries have developed a series of undergraduate research modules to answer just that. Learn to search databases, parse literature, manage citations, and more! 

Having good library skills pays. Not only will you save yourself time and frustration, but you may be eligible to apply for a library research award. Your working understanding of your discipline and ability to locate, analyze, and synthesize information effectively will put you on the fast track to your research goals.
