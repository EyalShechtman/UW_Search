					<description><![CDATA[The Office of Educational Assessment (OEA) is dedicated to the improvement of educational practice through assessment of teaching and learning, and through evaluation and support of educational programs and services.  In support of this commitment, OEA has developed several systems to support instruction at UW, including: a) ScorePak, a paper-based course examination scoring and statistical reporting service. ScorePak relies on data capture (optical marking scanning) of course grade sheets, which leads to data analysis and reporting for classroom test scoring; and b) IASystem, an online course evaluation application serving the three UW campuses and other post-secondary institutions across the United States. IASystem is a service to all of UW main Seattle campus as well as UW Tacoma, UW Bothell and Educational Outreach faculty.  IASystem data are gathered utilizing scannable questionnaires or online surveys, and the results are statistically generated, providing instructors with information for improving their teaching and curricula. Reports generated from ScorePak are utilizied primarily by faculty/instructors, while IASystem reports are utilized by instructors for improvement and administrators (deans, directors and chairs) as input for performance reviews and tenure and by students to select courses. The evaluation and scanning services specialist is responsible for coordination and day-to-day operation of the ScorePak scanning and scoring services for UW Seattle instructors, as well as for coordination of IASystem course evaluation services for UW Seattle. Advanced knowledge of the unique and proprietary computer, software and scanning systems supporting both ScorePak and IASystem function are required of the incumbent who serves in this position. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The RC has an outstanding opportunity for a dynamic, service-oriented, and student-centered individual to join our team as an academic coach/adviser.

The academic coach/adviser will assist students with a variety of areas related to academic learning at the university level including test-taking, study plans, improving study skills, coping with test anxiety and referrals for further support. This support will happen one-on-one, in small groups and in classroom settings. Additional areas of support may include time management, goal setting and supporting challenges with procrastination and motivation. This role will support students in the University's three accelerated programs (Transition School, Early Entrance Program (EEP), and UW Academy for Young Scholars. The Transition School program admits students into a one-year college-preparatory program after 8th grade, and upon successful completion, these students become fully matriculated University Washington students enrolled in the EEP program. Academically advanced students enter into the UW Academy after 10th grade.]]></description>
