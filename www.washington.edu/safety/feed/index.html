					<description><![CDATA[With meteorologists predicting colder and wetter-than-average conditions in the Pacific Northwest this winter, it’s a good time for Huskies to check out what the UW does when there’s snow and ice. If there’s snow in the forecast, how can I find out if there’s any change to UW classes or in-person work? If UW, UW Bothell or UW Tacoma decide to change operations due to the weather, we’ll share the news via email (a UW Advisory message) to students and...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s 7:45 p.m. on an October night and a sprinkle of stars can be seen in the sky above the University of Washington’s Seattle campus. Natalie Flores, a first-year UW student who just finished work at the Husky Union Building, is concerned about walking home across campus by herself. She calls 206-685-9255 for a ride home via a UW Police Department security guard. “It means a lot that I can call and get a safe ride,” Flores said. Through Husky...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you think about business continuity, the first thing that comes to mind probably isn’t zebrafish. Every unit at UW from Astrophysics to Zoology has a need for continuity planning in case of severe weather or a power outage or a different type of tragedy. Knowing what to do and who to call when something goes wrong that could affect the ability to hold classes, care for patients or conduct research is the heart of business continuity at the University...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UW scholars who are being targeted for harassment because of what they research, publish or say in the classroom may feel rightly anxious and overwhelmed. The online harassment can seem to come from nowhere and feel personal, even threatening. However, there are proven ways to outsmart harassers and help protect each other. UW Professor Monica R. McLemore, PhD, MPH, RN, the director of the Manning Price Spratlen Center for Anti-Racism &#38; Equity in Nursing and a reproductive justice advocate whose...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the past few months, the University of Washington has added more than 47,000 student phone numbers to the UW Alert system, so that more people will receive a text message when an emergency happens on or near campus in Seattle, Bothell and Tacoma. If you are one of those students, welcome!

Our priority is the safety and security of our campus community. We recognize that tensions are especially high due to events around the world, and our hope is that people with opposing views refrain...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you’re walking across campus, you’re probably not pausing to check your email. But right now, email is the only way most UW students receive time-sensitive information about emergencies happening on and near UW’s campuses. To make it easier for students to receive UW Alerts via text, at the end of January UW will start adding the phone number from your UW student profile to the UW Alert system. If the number is for a cell phone, UW will send...]]></description>
