<div class="js-accordion" data-accordion-prefix-classes="uw-accordion-shortcode">
<div class="js-accordion__panel" >
<h2 class="js-accordion__header">1. Find your unit's RSS feed URL</h2>
<p>In order to set up any customized alert for your unit&#8217;s stories, you first have to find the correct RSS feed URL. The video below walks you through how to do that using our <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:uwnews">Pinboard archive</a>, which is searchable by keyword, unit name, people, etc. Stories are displayed in the order in which they were added to the archive (most recent at the top).</p>
<div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br />
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-45462-1" width="1920" height="1040" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/18100125/How-to-get-a-unit-RSS-feed-from-Pinboard-1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/18100125/How-to-get-a-unit-RSS-feed-from-Pinboard-1.mp4">https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/18100125/How-to-get-a-unit-RSS-feed-from-Pinboard-1.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Once you have your unit&#8217;s RSS feed URL, you can use it in your favorite feed tracker tool (there are many options in the Chrome Web Store) or Outlook (for PC only).</p>
</div>
<div class="js-accordion__panel" >
<h2 class="js-accordion__header">2. Set up a feed alert in Outlook (PC only)</h2>
<p>Once you have your RSS feed URL from the previous step, open the Outlook app on your computer. Note: This is currently not available for Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>On the left-hand pane of your Outlook screen there should be a folder in your email account called &#8220;RSS Subscriptions.&#8221; Right click on that folder and click &#8220;Add a New RSS Feed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paste your RSS feed URL from the Pinboard archive into the field that Outlook offers, and click Add (see screenshot below).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-78515 alignnone" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/18091227/Add-RSS-feed-to-Outlook.jpg" alt="screenshot of adding a new RSS feed to Outlook" width="346" height="135" srcset="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/18091227/Add-RSS-feed-to-Outlook.jpg 346w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/18091227/Add-RSS-feed-to-Outlook-300x117.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></p>
<p>If prompted, click &#8220;Yes&#8221; when it asks you if you want to add this RSS Feed to Outlook.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;ll start getting new stories that mention your unit in your inbox as they are added to the UW News Pinboard archive!</p>

Avila (STScI)&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;In February 1987, on a mountaintop in Chile, telescope operator Oscar Duhalde stood outside the observatory at Las Campanas and looked up at the clear night sky. There, in a hazy-looking patch of brightness in the sky \u2014 the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a neighboring galaxy - was a bright star he hadn&#039;t noticed before.\r\n\r\nThat same night, Canadian astronomer Ian Shelton was at Las Campanas observing stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. As Shelton was studying a photographic plate of the LMC later that night, he noticed a bright object that he initially thought was a defect in the plate. When he showed the plate to other astronomers at the observatory, he realized the object was the light from a supernova. Duhalde announced that he saw the object too in the night sky. The object turned out to be Supernova 1987A, the closest exploding star observed in 400 years. Shelton had to notify the astronomical community of his discovery. There was no Internet in 1987, so the astronomer scrambled down the mountain to the nearest town and sent a message to the International Astronomical Union&#039;s Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, a clearing house for announcing astronomical discoveries.\r\n\r\nSince that finding, an armada of telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, has studied the supernova. Hubble wasn&#039;t even in space when SN 1987A was found. The supernova, however, was one of the first objects Hubble observed after its launch in 1990. Hubble has continued to monitor the exploded star for nearly 30 years, yielding insight into the messy aftermath of a star&#039;s violent self-destruction. Hubble has given astronomers a ring-side seat to watch the brightening of a ring around the dead star as the supernova blast wave slammed into it.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1486466357&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Dawn of a New Era for Supernova 1987A&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;keywords&quot;:[]}" data-image-title="SN 1987A" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;SN 1987a, a Type II supernova remnant first observed in 1987, is visible in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2017.
