<p>Since 2018 the <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/">Zwicky Transient Facility</a>, an international astronomical collaboration based at the Palomar Observatory in California, has scanned the entire sky every two to three nights. As part of this mission, the ZTF’s <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/ztf/bts/bts.php">Bright Transient Survey</a> has been counting and cataloguing supernovae — flashes of light in the sky that are the telltale signs of stars dying in spectacular explosions.</p>
<p>On Dec. 4, ZTF researchers — including astronomers at the University of Washington — announced that that they have identified more than 10,000 of these stellar events, the largest number ever identified by an astronomical survey.</p>

</div>
<p>“There are trillions of stars in the universe, and about every second, one of them explodes,” said Christoffer Fremling, an astronomer at Caltech who leads the Bright Transient Survey. “ZTF detects hundreds of these explosions per night and a handful are then confirmed as supernovae. Systematically doing this for seven years has led to the most complete record of confirmed supernovae to date.”</p>
<p>The Bright Transient Survey is currently the primary discovery pipeline for cosmic flashes — also known as astronomical transients — in the world. To determine which transients are supernovae, ZTF shares a stream of nightly transient detections with the wider astronomical community so that other telescopes around the world can conduct follow-up observations of candidate transients. This includes conducting a spectral analysis, in which instruments on observatory telescopes split the light from a transient object into its individual colors to reveal its distance from Earth and other properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Classifying 10,000 supernovae is a tremendous achievement and will enable unprecedented scientific studies of explosive transients,” said ZTF team member <a href="https://astro.washington.edu/people/eric-bellm">Eric Bellm</a>, a UW research associate professor of astronomy and scientist with the UW’s <a href="https://dirac.astro.washington.edu/">DiRAC Institute</a>. “Reaching this milestone required careful technical work on scheduling and processing the ZTF discovery images, human and machine vetting of the alerts and obtaining timely follow-up spectra.”</p>
<p>For the Bright Transient Survey, a 60-megapixel wide-field camera mounted on Palomar’s Samuel Oschin telescope scanned the entire visible sky every two nights. To detect new astronomical events, astronomers subtracted images of the same portion of the sky from subsequent scans. Next, members of the ZTF team studied the subtracted images and triggered follow-up spectral observations by a second telescope at Palomar or other observatories.</p>
<p>Bellm, UW research scientist <a href="https://astro.washington.edu/people/melissa-l-graham">Melissa Graham</a> and <a href="https://dirac.astro.washington.edu/person/mario-juric/">Mario Jurić</a>, UW professor of astronomy and director of the DiRAC Institute, all contributed to the Bright Transient Survey. Bellm managed alerts of new transients and scheduled imaging for the survey. Jurić helped set up the ZTF’s automated system to alert team members around the world of new transients.</p>
<p>Developing automated analysis pipelines and alert systems are critical for the field as more powerful imaging technologies and new generations of observatories continue to transform astronomy into a “big data” endeavor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a>, a 20th century astronomer who first coined the term “supernova,” identified 120 supernovae in 52 years. The Bright Transient Survey by the ZTF — named for Zwicky — found 10,000 in a fraction of that time.</p>
<p>“The Bright Transient Survey program serves as an exemplar for the kinds of science we hope to do with the <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> in the near future,&#8221; said Bellm.</p>
<p>Under construction in Chile, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is the future home of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or LSST, a mission that will take deep images of the sky nightly and detect even more cosmic transients than ZTF. UW scientists with the DiRAC Institute have been heavily involved in planning for the launch of the LSST. Collaborations like the ZTF have been a proving ground for developing and testing methods for use in the LSST.</p>
<p>For the Bright Transient Survey, Graham conducted follow-up spectral analyses of transients at <a href="https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/">Apache Point Observatory</a> in New Mexico. These efforts were especially valuable in catching some of the fainter, fading supernovae that would have been missed at Palomar.</p>
<p>&#8220;As UW astronomers, we are so fortunate to have access to the Apache Point Observatory for our research,” said Graham. “One of the most impactful — and fun — parts of obtaining optical spectra is being surprised by rare transients with peculiar characteristics, which often reveal more about supernova physics than hundreds of ordinary objects. Figuring out how to do this work with the even larger number of LSST supernovae is the next big challenge.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">SN 1987a, a Type II supernova remnant first observed in 1987, is visible in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2017. The bright ring around the exploded star is material it had ejected approximately 20,000 years before its demise. The Zwicky Transient Facility recently announced that it has discovered more than 10,000 supernovae, most of them Type II or Type Ia.<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2017/08/3987-Image.html"><span class="wp-media-credit">NASA/ESA/Robert Kirshner/Max Mutchler/Roberto Avila</span></a></span></p>
</div>
<p>Most of the transients in the Bright Transient Survey are classified as one of two common types of supernovae: Type Ia, when a white dwarf steals so much material from another nearby star that it explodes, or Type II, when massive stars collapse and die under their own gravity. Thanks to the treasure trove of data from the Bright Transient Survey, astronomers are now better equipped to answer questions about how stars grow and die, as well as how dark energy drives the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>After its expected 2025 commissioning, the Vera Rubin C. Observatory could discover millions more supernovae.</p>
<p>“The machine learning and AI tools we have developed for ZTF will become essential when the Vera Rubin Observatory begins operations,” said ZTF team member Daniel Perley, an astronomer at Liverpool John Moores University. “We have already planned to work closely with Rubin to transfer our machine learning knowledge and technology.”</p>
<p>With an additional $1.6 million of funding from the National Science Foundation, ZTF will continue to scan the night sky for the next two years.</p>
<p>“The period in 2025 and 2026 when ZTF and Vera Rubin can both operate in tandem is fantastic news for time-domain astronomers,” said Mansi Kasliwal, an astronomy professor at Caltech who will lead ZTF in the next two years. “Combining data from both observatories, astronomers can directly address the physics of why supernovae explode and discover fast and young transients that are inaccessible to ZTF or Rubin alone. I am excited about the future.”</p>

</div>
<p>Amid all the changes in Earth’s climate, sea ice in the stormy Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica was, for a long time, an odd exception. The maximum winter sea ice cover remained steady or even increased slightly from the late 1970s through 2015, despite rising global temperatures.</p>
<p>That began to change in 2016. Several years of decline led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/climate/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an all-time record low in 2023</a>, more than five standard deviations below the average from the satellite record. The area of sea ice was 2.2 million square kilometers below the average from the satellite record, a loss almost 12 times the size of Washington state. The most recent winter’s peak, recorded in September 2024, was <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/10/03/antarctica-had-less-winter-sea-ice-than-ever-in-2023-and-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very close</a> to the previous year’s record low.</p>
<p>University of Washington researchers show that the all-time record low can be explained by warm Southern Ocean conditions and patterns in the winds that circled Antarctica months earlier, allowing forecasts for sea ice coverage around the South Pole to be generated six or more months in advance. This could support regional and global weather and climate models.</p>
<p>The open-access <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01772-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> was published Nov. 20 in Nature Communications Earth &amp; Environment.</p>
<p>“Since 2015, total Antarctic sea ice area has dramatically declined,” said lead author <a href="https://zacespinosa.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zac Espinosa</a>, a UW doctoral student in atmospheric and climate science. “State-of-the-art forecasting methods for sea ice generally struggle to produce reliable forecasts at such long leads.

<p class="wp-caption-text">The maximum Antarctic sea ice extent in 2023, shown here, was the lowest on record. The yellow line shows the average winter maximum of satellite observations from 1981 to 2010.

</div>
<p>The authors used a global climate model to simulate how ocean and air temperatures, including longer-term cycles like El Niño and La Niña, affect sea ice in the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>Results showed that the 2023 El Niño was less important than previously thought. Instead, an arching pattern of regional winds, and their effects on ocean temperatures up to six months in advance, could explain 70% of the 2023 record-low winter sea ice. These winds cause ocean mixing in the Southern Ocean that can pull deeper warm water up to the surface, thus suppressing sea ice growth. Winds can also push sea ice poleward toward Antarctica to prevent the sea ice edge from expanding north, transport heat from lower latitudes toward the poles, and generate ocean waves that break up sea ice.</p>
<p>Using the same approach for the 2024 observations correctly predicted that this would be another low year for Southern Ocean sea ice cover.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting that, despite how unusual the winter sea ice conditions were in 2023 and again in 2024, our results show they were remarkably predictable over 6 months in advance,” said co-author <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/edward-blanchard-wrigglesworth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward Blanchard-Wrigglesworth</a>, a UW research associate professor of atmospheric and climate science.</p>
<div class="info-box info-box-large">Although doctoral student Zac Espinosa does most of his research with a computer, last summer he participated in a <a href="https://www.arm.gov/news/blog/post/100459">research expedition</a> to study Arctic sea ice in the field.</div>
<p>Antarctic sea ice is important because it affects marine and coastal ecosystems and interactions between ocean and atmosphere in the Southern Ocean. It also affects global climate by reflecting sunlight in the Southern Hemisphere and influencing ice sheets and global currents.</p>
<p>“Antarctic sea ice is a major control on the rate of global warming and the stability of ice on the Antarctic continent,” Espinosa said. “In fact, the sea ice acts to buttress ice shelves, increasing their stability and slowing the rate of global sea level rise. This ice is also important for marine and coastal ecosystems.”</p>
<p>As summer arrives in the Southern Hemisphere, the <a href="https://zacklabe.com/antarctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current sea ice extent</a> remains sparse around Antarctica, close to a record low for this time of the year.</p>
<p>“Our success at predicting these major sea ice loss events so far in advance demonstrates our understanding of the mechanism that caused them,” said co-author <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/cecilia-bitz/">Cecilia Bitz</a>, a UW professor of atmospheric and climate science. “Our model and methods are geared up to predict future sea ice loss events.”</p>
<p>The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>

<p>Hummingbird bills — their long, thin beaks — look a little like drinking straws. The frenetic speed at which they get nectar out of flowers and backyard feeders may give the impression that the bills act as straws, too. But new research shows just how little water, or nectar, that comparison holds.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0286">paper</a> published online Nov. 27 by the Proceedings of the Royal Society Interface, an international team led by <a href="https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/alejandro-rico-guevara-0">Alejandro Rico-Guevara</a>, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Washington, reveals the surprising flexibility of the hummingbird bill. The team discovered that a drinking hummingbird rapidly opens and shuts different parts of its bill simultaneously, engaging in an intricate and highly coordinated dance with its tongue to draw up nectar at lightning speeds.</p>
<p>To human eyes, these movements are barely perceptible. But for hummingbirds, they’re a lifeline.</p>

<p>“Most hummingbirds drink while they’re hovering mid-flight,” said Rico-Guevara, who is also curator of ornithology at the UW’s <a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/">Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture</a>. “Energetically, that is very expensive. Flying straight at commuting speeds uses up less energy than hovering to drink. So, hummingbirds are trying to minimize energy and drink as fast as they can — all from these hard-to-reach spaces — which requires special adaptations for speed and efficiency.”</p>
<p>Previous research showed that hummingbirds extend their tongues in rapid-fire movements when drinking nectar. But scientists did not know what role the bill itself played in feeding. The team collected high-speed video footage of individual hummingbirds from six different species drinking at transparent feeders at field sites in Colombia, Ecuador and the U.S. By analyzing the footage and combining it with data from micro-CT scans of hummingbird specimens at the Yale Peabody Museum, researchers discovered the intricate bill movements that underlie drinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>To extend its tongue, the hummingbird opens just the tip of its bill</li>
<li>After the tongue brings in nectar, the bill tip closes</li>
<li>To draw nectar up the bill, the hummingbird keeps the bill’s midsection shut tightly, while opening the base slightly</li>
<li>Then, it opens its tip again to extend the tongue for a new cycle, a process many hummingbird species can do 10-15 times a second</li>
</ul>

<p>Hummingbirds have intricately shaped tongues, some resembling origami-like patterns for unfolding and collecting nectar. This new research shows just how important the bill is for drinking and that, despite its rigid outward appearance, it is remarkably flexible.</p>
<p>“We already knew that hummingbird bills have some flexibility, for example bending their lower bill while catching insects,” said Rico-Guevara. “But now we know that the bill plays this very active and essential role in drawing up nectar that the tongue collects.”</p>
<p>The bill’s role also makes hummingbirds unique among animals by relying on two types of fluid collection and transport methods: the lapping mechanism — formally known as Couette flow — which animals like dogs and cats use to drink, and Poiseuille flow, a suction-driven mechanism used, for example, by mosquitoes drinking blood or by humans drinking through a straw. Often, animals employ one approach or the other. Hummingbirds are a rare example of using both.</p>
<p>“It makes sense that they would have to use both, given the pressure to reach the nectar deep within the flower and to feed quickly and efficiently,” said Rico-Guevara.</p>

<p>Future research could try to find the muscles that control these movements, and investigate how other uses for the bill — such as catching insects — impact its flexibility.</p>
<p>“As plants evolved flowers of different lengths and shapes, hummingbird bills have evolved accordingly,” said Rico-Guevara. “Every time we answer one set of questions about hummingbird adaptation, new ones arise. There’s so much more to learn.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Talking climate and weather with Washington State Climatologists" width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrmuAgyXPFg?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.washington.edu" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>From its base at the southwest corner of the Seattle campus, the <a href="https://climate.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of the Washington State Climatologist</a> provides expertise, tools and resources on “all things climate” to partners and communities across the state.</p>
<p><a href="https://cig.uw.edu/about/people/guillaume-mauger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guillaume Mauger</a> was announced in the spring as the <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/news/2024/05/guillaume-mauger-named-washington-state-climatologist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Washington state climatologist</a>. Mauger is a research scientist with the UW Climate Impacts Group, which now houses the state climatologist’s office. Mauger’s research focuses mainly on <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2015/11/17/new-report-outlines-puget-sound-regions-future-under-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water and floods</a> in the context of climate change.</p>
<p><a href="https://cig.uw.edu/about/people/karin-bumbaco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karin Bumbaco</a>, a UW research scientist and the deputy state climatologist, studies such things as <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2013/07/19/nighttime-heat-waves-quadruple-in-pacific-northwest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nighttime heat</a> in Seattle and new ways to <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/02/10/online-tool-displays-pacific-northwest-mountain-snow-depth/">display</a> <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2018/11/26/uw-tableau-create-interactive-tool-to-explore-more-than-a-century-of-pacific-northwest-weather-observations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather data</a>, as well as other trends involving heat and drought.</p>
<p>Together, they provide data and share news on whatever’s in the skies. From heat domes to hailstorms, from snowpack to summer drought, they provide perspective on the short-term and long-term weather woes and questions facing Washingtonians.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to help people understand the climate and how it affects their daily lives,” Mauger said.</p>
<p>Right now, many people in the region are curious about the upcoming winter season.</p>
<p>“This year we’re expecting to see a weak La Niña develop in the tropical Pacific Ocean,” Bumbaco said. For Washington that means “on average, we tend to have cooler-than-normal temperatures, a little bit more precipitation, and more snowpack by the end of our winter season during La Niña winters.”</p>
<p>Mauger and Bumbaco also conduct research on changes in rainfall patterns and flood risks, and on temperatures and wildfire risks for the coming season and over the longer term. Visit the Office of the Washington State Climatologist’s website to check out the seasonal <a href="https://climate.washington.edu/outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate outlook</a>, a list of <a href="https://climate.washington.edu/state-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington state records</a> or to subscribe to a <a href="https://climate.washington.edu/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly newsletter</a> on the current state of Washington’s climate.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Every Monday, Tory Johnston welcomes listeners to KEXP&#8217;s global Indigenous radio show, Sounds of Survivance.<span class="wp-media-credit">Pixabay</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>When he isn’t lecturing at the University of Washington or pursuing his doctoral studies at the University of California, Davis, <a href="https://www.kexp.org/djs/tory-j/">Tory Johnston</a> (Quinault) co-hosts a global Indigenous radio show with Kevin Sur (Kānaka Maoli) on KEXP.</p>
<p>Every Monday between 3 and 5 a.m., he welcomes listeners to <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/kexp.org/indigenous__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!ln4QlRvPYsE1P7SZbiEQ3sfZ6u38QquSjK-FePUUhEyhm8e4ZuKzzBHSvwynm78zTjvuWHwfzg$">Sounds of Survivance</a>, playing cross-continental Indigenous music from a variety of genres. After sunrise, Johnston can be found in the UW’s Department of American Indian Studies, teaching classes like “United States/Indian Relations” and “Contemporary Indigenous Environmental Issues.</p>
<p>For someone who fell in love with music as a child – learning how to play Metallica riffs and listening to everything from virtuosic guitar to jazz – studying and amplifying Indigenous sound represents a full-circle moment.</p>
<div class="info-box info-box-large">In October, KEXP celebrated Indigenous Peoples’ Day with all-day special programming hosted by Tory Johnston and Kevin Sur, along with other KEXP DJs and special guests. You can listen to the event <a href="https://www.kexp.org/indigenous-peoples-day/">on KEXP’s website</a>.</div>
<p>“I’m interested in what Native music does, meeting Indigenous people where they’re at and conveying the authentic love for sound and music that comes through in their songs,” said Johnston, whose doctoral work in Native American studies at UC Davis focuses on Indigenous sounds and music. “It’s not just like ‘traditional music’ that we play on the show. It’s hip-hop and metal and jazz. There&#8217;s just as much of a sort of semantic potency to that as there is in the songs that our ancestors made.”</p>
<p>Johnston was raised in Taholah, Washington, on the mouth of the Quinault River. He graduated in 2015 from the UW, the only school he ever wanted to attend, with a degree in American Indian studies. He saw the department as a way to cultivate a home away from home.</p>
<p>“It was kind of hard reckoning with the idea that all land is Indigenous land, and the UW sits on the dispossessed land of the Coast Salish peoples,” Johnston said. “But I always give thanks to and gratitude toward the people that animate the Native presence in Seattle, including the American Indian Studies Department. The Quinault and other Coast Salish peoples have interacted for thousands of years, so the lands and waters we’re on here are familiar to my ancestors.”</p>
<p>After earning his bachelor’s degree, Johnston worked as an outreach coordinator for the Department of the Interior’s <a href="https://www.doi.gov/buybackprogram">Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations,</a> as well as a Native youth suicide prevention coordinator for the Seattle Indian Health Board. Needing a change, he then decided to pursue a graduate degree at UC Davis.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Tory Johnston is a lecturer in the American Indian Studies Department at the UW.<span class="wp-media-credit">KEXP</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>Originally, Johnston planned to focus his graduate studies on environmental law and policy before enrolling in law school. That all changed when Johnston met <a href="https://ais.washington.edu/people/jessica-bissett-perea">Jessica Bissett Perea</a> (Dena’ina), an interdisciplinary music scholar who then worked at UC Davis and is now associate professor of American Indian Studies at the UW. Bissett Perea’s Indigenous-led and Indigeneity-centered work changed Johnston’s perspective and pushed him to focus his work on Indigenous sound and music.</p>
<p>“Bissett Perea’s work as a musicologist awoke this thing in me, which was this musicality that I&#8217;ve had my entire life,” Johnston said. “I&#8217;ve always, always loved music, and I&#8217;ve always thought deeply about it, too. She showed me those ideas and that way of thinking was possible through an Indigeneity-centered lens.”</p>
<p>On Bissett Perea’s suggestion, Johnston applied for a lecturer position at the UW. Ten days after he was offered the job, another opportunity arose. A friend alerted Johnston that KEXP was hiring a global Indigenous radio DJ. Johnston had never DJed before, but the station was seeking applicants with both scholarly and musical backgrounds. Johnston checked both boxes and, as a bonus, he brought basic knowledge of audio production.</p>
<p>“KEXP has a global audience,” Johnston said. “That’s one of the most humbling things ,is for them to trust me to take the reins and show our thousands and thousands of listeners these Native artists that I love. It’s an absolute joy. It’s one of my favorite things I’ve ever done in my life.”</p>

</div>
<p>When he hosts, Johnston offers his perspective on what it means to be an Indigenous musician. Indigenous musicians have been invisible contributors to the musical canon of every genre, Johnston said, and representing their genuine, authentic love for both Indigeneity and music ties in with the name of the show: Sounds of Survivance.</p>
<p>‘Survivance,’ a term coined by American Indian studies scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Vizenor">Gerald Vizenor</a>, represents a combination of survival and resistance. It’s about the continuance of Indigenous stories, and the renunciation of narratives centered around tragedy and victimhood.</p>
<p>“That’s sort of the ethic of the show,” Johnston said. “It’s demonstrating: One, we’ve always been here. Two, we’ve always been making songs. Three, these songs are really beautiful. Let me show them to you.”</p>
<p>Johnston aims to play a part amplifying an Indigenous legacy of sound and artistry that’s been intentionally obscured.</p>
<p>“It’s refusing to let ourselves be erased,” Johnston said. “We mobilize using the same processes that our ancestors did. They gave us this gift of being able to create song, and so we decided to use it. It’s self-determining. It’s personal and collective sovereignty over the ways that we want to sound.”</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">New research led by the University of Washington found that wildfire smoke is especially hazardous. An analysis of the health care records of 1.2 million Southern California residents found that higher long-term smoke exposure was associated with a significant increase in the odds that a person would be diagnosed with dementia. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The researchers </span><a href="https://aaic.alz.org/releases-2024/exposure-wildfire-smoke-raises-dementia-risk.asp"><span data-contrast="none">presented their findings</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in July and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2827124">published the full study Nov. 25 in JAMA Neurology.</a></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“There have been studies that have found total PM2.5 is related to people developing dementia, but no one had looked specifically at wildfire PM2.5,” said lead author </span><a href="https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/joan-casey"><span data-contrast="none">Joan Casey</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a UW associate professor of environmental &amp; occupational health sciences. “Wildfire smoke is a different animal, in that it’s much spikier. There are many days where there’s no wildfire smoke, and there are some days where exposure is really, really extreme.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Researchers analyzed the health records of 1.2 million members aged 60 and older of Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2008 and 2019, all of whom were free from dementia at the start of the study period. They estimated each person’s long-term exposure to both wildfire and non-wildfire PM2.5 as a three-year rolling average, and then identified people who received a dementia diagnosis.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Researchers found that for every 1 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) increase in three-year average wildfire PM2.5 concentration, the odds of a dementia diagnosis increased by 18%. Exposure to non-wildfire PM2.5 also increased a person’s risk of dementia, but to a much lesser degree. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“One microgram per meter cubed might sound fairly small, but we have to think about how people are exposed to wildfire smoke,” Casey said. “Most days they aren’t exposed at all, so this might represent a few days of exposure at a concentration of something like 300 µg/m3, where the AQI is over 200 in someone’s community. When you think about it, it’s actually a few really severe wildfire smoke days that might translate into increased risk.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That risk further increased among racialized people and those living in high-poverty census tracts, following long-term trends in which vulnerable populations often experience disproportionate effects of environmental hazards. The authors suggested that disparities might be related to lower-quality housing, which can increase the amount of smoke that enters people’s homes, or lower-income families’ inability to afford air filtration systems. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The study period does not include the summers of 2020 and 2021, which produced the most </span><a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/smoke-covered-70-california-during-biggest-wildfire-years"><span data-contrast="none">extreme wildfire seasons</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> recorded in California.

<p><span data-contrast="none">&#8220;The main culprit here is climate change,” Casey said. “It&#8217;s a global problem.

<p>The University of Washington was ranked No. 15 in the world for interdisciplinary scientific research, according to a new <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/interdisciplinary-science-rankings">list</a> published earlier this month by the U.K.-based Times Higher Education. The UW placed in the top 10 among U.S. institutions. Among U.S. public institutions, the UW placed fifth.</p>
<p>The top three institutions overall were Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and National University of Singapore.</p>
<p>Times Higher Education said that interdisciplinary science refers to the integration of the knowledge, traditions and processes from multiple scientific disciplines. It can involve multiple academics who collaborate with one another across different disciplines. It may also be a single academic researcher approaching a scientific question across multiple disciplines.</p>
<p>The Interdisciplinary Science Rankings, launched in association with Schmidt Science Fellows, is the first effort of its kind to measure universities’ contributions and commitment to interdisciplinary science, according to Times Higher Education.</p>
<p>The analysis includes 11 carefully calibrated performance indicators to assess institutions across three key areas, each representing a stage in the life cycle of research projects: inputs (funding); process (measures of success, facilities, administrative support and promotion); and outputs (publications, research quality and reputation).

<p>How did the West Coast become the “Left Coast” and what does that mean for American politics? The term “Left Coast” has further underlined the significance of progressive and radical movements in these states&#8217; political systems and reputations. In this talk, Gregory explores the history of West Coast radicalism and factors that have made it influential beyond what is common in other regions, including those with blue-state traditions.</p>

<p>Artist Statement: With work emphasizing materiality in found objects and mediums like clay, textile, stone, wood, and metal, I examine identity, lineage, dichotomy, one’s surroundings in both the physical and intangible sense and the cultural connections we hold through relation to our land environments and the beings that coexist within it. I believe to understand ourselves we must not only acknowledge our places of origins and current surroundings, but also prioritize our bonds with nature as deep soul work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new study led by the University of Washington has for the first time quantified the risk for whale-ship collisions worldwide for four geographically widespread ocean giants that are threatened by shipping: blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales. In a paper published online Nov. 21 in Science, researchers report that global shipping traffic overlaps with about 92% of these whale species’ ranges. Only about 7% of areas at highest risk for whale-ship collisions have any measures in place to protect whales from this threat. These measures include speed reductions, both mandatory and voluntary, for ships crossing waters that overlap with whale migration or feeding areas.

<p>According to the fossil record, cetaceans — whales, dolphins and their relatives — evolved from four-legged land mammals that returned to the oceans beginning some 50 million years ago. Today, their descendants are threatened by a different land-based mammal that has also returned to the sea: humans.</p>

<p>Thousands of whales are injured or killed each year after being struck by ships, particularly the large container vessels that ferry 80% of the world’s traded goods across the oceans. Collisions are the leading cause of death worldwide for large whale species. Yet global data on ship strikes of whales are hard to come by — impeding efforts to protect vulnerable whale species. A new study led by the University of Washington has for the first time quantified the risk for whale-ship collisions worldwide for four geographically widespread ocean giants that are threatened by shipping: blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1950">paper</a> published online Nov. 21 in Science, researchers report that global shipping traffic overlaps with about 92% of these whale species’ ranges.</p>
<p>“This translates to ships traveling thousands of times the distance to the moon and back within these species’ ranges each and every year, and this problem is only projected to increase as global trade grows in the coming decades,” said senior author <a href="https://www.abrahmslab.com/">Briana Abrahms</a>, a UW assistant professor of biology and researcher with the <a href="https://ecosystemsentinels.org/">Center for Ecosystem Sentinels</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>“Whale-ship collisions have typically only been studied at a local or regional level — like off the east and west coasts of the continental U.S., and patterns of risk remain unknown for large areas,” said lead author Anna Nisi, a UW postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. “Our study is an attempt to fill those knowledge gaps and understand the risk of ship strikes on a global level. It’s important to understand where these collisions are likely to occur because there are some really simple interventions that can substantially reduce collision risk.”</p>
<p>The team found that only about 7% of areas at highest risk for whale-ship collisions have any measures in place to protect whales from this threat. These measures include speed reductions, both mandatory and voluntary, for ships crossing waters that overlap with whale migration or feeding areas.</p>

<p>“As much as we found cause for concern, we also found some big silver linings,” said Abrahms. “For example, implementing management measures across only an additional 2.6% of the ocean’s surface would protect all of the highest-risk collision hotspots we identified.”</p>
<p>“Trade-offs between industrial and conservation outcomes are not usually this optimal,” said co-author <a href="https://welch.sites.ucsc.edu/">Heather Welch</a>, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Oftentimes industrial activities must be greatly limited to achieve conservation goals, or vice versa. In this case, there is a potentially large conservation benefit to whales for not much cost to the shipping industry.”</p>
<p>Those highest-risk areas for the four whale species included in the study lie largely along coastal areas in the Mediterranean, portions of the Americas, southern Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>The international team behind the study, which includes researchers across five continents, looked at the waters where these four whale species live, feed and migrate by pooling data from disparate sources — including government surveys, sightings by members of the public, tagging studies and even whaling records. The team collected some 435,000 unique whale sightings. They then combined this novel database with information on the courses of 176,000 cargo vessels from 2017 to 2022 — tracked by each ship’s automatic identification system and processed using an algorithm from Global Fishing Watch — to identify where whales and ships are most likely to meet.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">These three panels indicate the degree of spatial overlap between whales and shipping traffic from 2017 to 2022.

<p>The study uncovered regions already known to be high-risk areas for ship strikes: North America’s Pacific coast, Panama, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. But it also identified understudied regions at high risk for whale-ship collisions, including southern Africa; South America along the coasts of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Ecuador; the Azores; and East Asia off the coasts of China, Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>The team found that mandatory measures to reduce whale-ship collisions were very rare, overlapping just 0.54% of blue whale hotspots and 0.27% of humpback hotspots, and not overlapping any fin or sperm whale hotspots. Though many collision hotspots fell within marine protected areas, these preserves often lack speed limits for vessels, as they were largely established to curb fishing and industrial pollution.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">This panel shows the relative levels of both whales and shipping globally. Yellow-shaded areas indicate high shipping traffic but low whale occurrence. Purple-shaded areas show the opposite: Regions that are of high importance to whales, but with low levels of shipping. Burgundy-shaded regions indicate areas of high overlap between whales and ships, which are at higher risk of whale-ship collisions.<span class="wp-media-credit">Anna Nisi</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>For all four species the vast majority of hotspots for whale-ship strikes — more than 95% — hugged coastlines, falling within a nation’s exclusive economic zone. That means that each country could implement its own protection measures in coordination with the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization.</p>
<p>“From the standpoint of conservation, the fact that most high-risk areas lie within exclusive economic zones is actually encouraging,” said Nisi. “It means individual countries have the ability to protect the riskiest areas.”</p>
<p>Of the limited measures now in place, most are along the Pacific coast of North America and in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to speed reduction, other options to reduce whale-ship strikes include changing vessel routings away from where whales are located, or creating <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/09/17/whale-safe-ucsb/">alert systems</a> to notify authorities and mariners when whales are nearby.</p>
<p>“Lowering vessel speed in hotspots also carries additional benefits, such as reducing underwater noise pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting air pollution, which helps people living in coastal areas,” said Nisi.</p>

<p>The authors hope their global study could spur local or regional research to map out the hotspot zones in finer detail, inform advocacy efforts and consider the impact of climate change, which will change both whale and ship distributions as sea ice melts and ecosystems shift.</p>
<p>“Protecting whales from the impact of ship strikes is a huge global challenge. We’ve seen the benefits of slowing ships down at local scales through programs like ‘<a href="https://www.bluewhalesblueskies.org/">Blue Whales Blue Skies</a>’ in California. Scaling up such programs will require a concerted effort by conservation organizations, governments and shipping companies,” said co-author Jono Wilson, director of ocean science at the California Chapter of <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/">The Nature Conservancy</a>, which helped identify the need for this study and secured its funding. “Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems. Through this study we have measurable insights into ship-collision hotspots and risk and where we need to focus to make the most impact.”</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">In most doctors’ offices these days, you’ll find a pattern: Everybody’s Googling, all the time. Physicians search for clues to a diagnosis, or for reminders on the best treatment plans. Patients scour WebMD, tapping in their symptoms and doomscrolling a long list of possible problems. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But those constant searches leave something to be desired. Doctors don’t have the time to sift through pages of results, and patients don’t have the knowledge to digest medical research. Everybody has trouble finding the most reliable information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Optimists believe artificial intelligence could help solve those problems, but the bots might not be ready for prime time. In a </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000619"><span data-contrast="none">recent paper</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, </span><a href="https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/gary-m-franklin"><span data-contrast="none">Dr. Gary Franklin</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a University of Washington research professor of environmental &amp; occupational health sciences and of neurology in the UW School of Medicine, described a troubling experience with Google’s Gemini chatbot. When Franklin asked Gemini for information on the outcomes of a specific procedure – a decompressive brachial plexus surgery – the bot gave a detailed answer that cited two medical studies, neither of which existed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Franklin wrote that it’s “buyer beware when it comes to using AI Chatbots for the purposes of extracting accurate scientific information or evidence-based guidance.” He recommended that AI experts develop specialized chatbots that pull information only from verified sources. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One expert working toward a solution is </span><a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/lucylw"><span data-contrast="none">Lucy Lu Wang</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a UW assistant professor in the Information School who focuses on making AI better at understanding and relaying scientific information.

<p><span data-contrast="none">UW News sat down with Franklin and Wang to discuss how AI could enhance health care, what’s standing in the way, and whether there&#8217;s a downside to democratizing medical research. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Each of you has studied the possibilities and perils of AI in health care, including the experiences of patients who ask chatbots for medical information. In a best-case scenario, how do you envision AI being used in health and medicine?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Gary Franklin: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">Doctors use Google a lot, but they also rely on services like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UpToDate"><span data-contrast="none">UpToDate,</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> which provide really great summaries of medical information and research. Most doctors have zero time and just want to be able to read something very quickly that is well documented. So from a physician’s perspective trying to find truthful answers, trying to make my practice more efficient, trying to coordinate things better — if this technology could meaningfully contribute to any of those things, then it would be unbelievably great. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span data-contrast="none">I&#8217;m not sure how much doctors will use AI, but for many years, patients have been coming in with questions about what they found on the internet, </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/"><span data-contrast="none">like on WebMD</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. AI is just the next step of patients doing this, getting some guidance about what to do with the advice they’re getting. As an example, if a patient sees a surgeon who&#8217;s overly aggressive and says they need a big procedure, the patient could ask an AI tool what the broader literature might recommend. And I have concerns about that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Lucy Lu Wang: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">I&#8217;ll take this question from the clinician&#8217;s perspective, and then from the patient&#8217;s perspective. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">From the clinician&#8217;s perspective, I agree with what Gary said. Clinicians want to look up information very quickly because they&#8217;re so taxed and there&#8217;s limited time to treat patients. And you can imagine if the tools that we have, these chatbots, were actually very good at searching for information and very good at citing accurately, that they could become a better replacement for a type of tool like UpToDate, right? Because UpToDate is good, it’s human-curated, but it doesn’t always contain the most fine-grained information you might be looking for.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

</div>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These tools could also potentially help clinicians with patient communication, because there&#8217;s not always enough time to follow up or explain things in a way that patients can understand. It’s an add-on part of the job for clinicians, and that’s where I think language models and these tools, in an ideal world, could be really beneficial. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Lastly, on the patient’s side, it would be really amazing to develop these tools that help with patient education and help increase the overall health literacy of the population, beyond what WebMD or Google does. These tools could engage patients with their own health and health</span> <span data-contrast="none">care more than before. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Zooming out from the individual to the systemic, do you see any ways AI could make health systems as a whole function more smoothly?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">GF: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">One thing I’m curious about is whether these tools can be used to help with coordination across the health care system and between physicians. It&#8217;s horrible. There was a book called “</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25057539/"><span data-contrast="none">Crossing the Quality Chasm</span></a><span data-contrast="none">”</span><span data-contrast="none"> that argued the main problem in American medicine is poor coordination across specialties, or between primary care and anybody else. It&#8217;s still horrible, because there&#8217;s no function in the medical field that actually does that. So that&#8217;s another question: Is there a role here for this kind of technology in coordinating health care?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">LLW: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">There&#8217;s been a lot of work on tools that can summarize a patient&#8217;s medical history in their clinical notes, and that could be one way to perform this kind of communication between specialties. There’s another component, too: If patients can directly interact with the system, we can construct a better timeline of the patient&#8217;s experiences and how that relates to their clinical medical care.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">We’ve done qualitative research with health care seekers that suggests there are lots of types of questions that people are less willing to ask their clinical provider, but much more willing to put into one of these models. So the models themselves are potentially addressing unmet needs that patients aren’t willing to directly share with their doctors.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">What’s standing in the way of these best-case scenarios? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">LLW: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">I</span> <span data-contrast="none">think there are both technical challenges and socio-technical challenges. In terms of technical challenges, a lot of these models’ training doesn’t currently make them effective for tasks like scientific search and summarization. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">First, these current chatbots are mostly trained to be general-purpose tools, so they&#8217;re meant to be OK at everything, but not great at anything. And I think there will be more targeted development towards these more specific tasks, things like scientific search with citations that Gary mentioned before. The current training methods tend to produce models that are instruction-following, and have a very large positive response bias in their outputs. That can lead to things like generating answers with citations that support the answer, even if those citations don&#8217;t exist in the real world. These models are also trained to be overconfident in their responses. If the way the model communicates is positive and overconfident, then it&#8217;s going to lead to lots of problems in a domain like health care. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And then, of course, there&#8217;s socio-technical problems, like, maybe these models should be developed with the specific goal of supporting scientific search. People are, in fact, working toward these things and have demonstrated good preliminary results.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">GF: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">So are the folks in your field pretty confident that that can be overcome in a fairly short time?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">LLW: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">I think the citation problem has already been overcome in research demonstration cases. If we, for example, hook up an LLM to PubMed search and allow it only to cite conclusions based on articles that are indexed in PubMed, then actually the models are very faithful to citations that are retrieved from that search engine. But if you use Gemini and ChatGPT, those are not always hooked up to those research databases. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">GF: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">The problem is that a person trying to search using those tools doesn’t know that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">LLW: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">Right, that&#8217;s a problem. People tend to trust these things because, as an example, we now have AI-generated answers at the top of Google search, and people have historically trusted Google search to only index documents that people have written, maybe putting the ones that are more trustworthy at the top. But that AI-generated response can be full of misinformation. What&#8217;s happening is that some people are losing trust in traditional search as a consequence. It’s going to be hard to build back that trust, even if we improve the technology.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">We&#8217;re really at the beginning of this technology. It took a long time for us to develop meaningful resources on the internet — things like Wikipedia or PubMed. Right now, these chatbots are general-purpose tools, but there are already starting to be mixtures of models underneath. And in the future, they’re going to get better at routing people&#8217;s queries to the correct expert models, whether that’s to the model hooked up to PubMed or to trusted documents published by various associates related to health care. And I think that’s likely where we&#8217;re headed in the next couple of years. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Trust and reliability issues aside, are there any potential downsides to deploying these tools widely? I can see a potential problem with people using chatbots to self-diagnose when it might be preferable to see a provider.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">LLW: </span></b><span data-contrast="none">You think of a resource like WebMD: Was that a net positive or net negative? Before its existence, patients really did have a hard time finding any information at all. And of course, there&#8217;s limited face time with clinicians where people actually get to ask those questions. So for every patient who wrongly self-diagnoses on WebMD, there are probably also hundreds of patients who found a quick answer to a question.
