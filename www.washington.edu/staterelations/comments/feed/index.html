					<description><![CDATA[Dear President Wise, 
   I know the budget is a problem, but using this issue to control all promotions with in the U. is not fair: my wife has been doing grant work for years with out of her title, grade, or pay scale. 
   Her dept. recently asked U/W personnel to promote her--even though she is qualified, she has been declined due to &quot;union rules prohibiting her promotion from a union member to a non union position--internally its about money. The worst of it is that she will be required to continue as a grant writer--well outside of her job description and pay scale. This is not right. 
   She has faithfully and continuously worked for the U.for 25 years. 
   Yes, the budget crisis is important, but fairness?
                                       
Best Regards,
Fred Doehring]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I watched Miss. Shepard on TVW talking to the legislators against online education on how she says the UW gives more opportunity. Well that is not true, every single person I went to high school with was and has been for decades been prevented from going to the UW. We don&#039;t speak a second language= and never will.  They don&#039;t want all of us who had to pay to become engineers at community colleges just because we cant learn other languages but we have IQs of 140+ so we drop out, join gangs, go to prison, become homeless and so forth! An illegal gets more opportunity and we are the ones who are far more competent in science fields then before we went to school. I had a perfect 4.0 in computer science and slept through class working 84 hours a week. and still cant get more then a ditch digging job after wasting money for school. I already had 25 years experience in PCs. MY wife , me and my child will loose our house just because we applied for Obamas program and were not even late, it was a set up for the banks land grab. This country is ignorant and the young people don&#039;t even know calculus or clear English. What will they do for work if I taking the labor jobs. The UW is discriminatory against US born graduates and I can go there with my AAS and so many skills and they will refuse me as a student no matter how much cash I have.FACT]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear State Relations:

This is actually a comment on your FAQs.  The UW continues to ignore key facts about why it&#039;s losing state funding.  First, the state needs more folks with math, science, and engineering degrees, not more English, Political Science, and communications baccalaureates.  Every time you make across the board cuts, you hurt the majors and departments we need as much as you hurt majors and departments we don&#039;t need.  The UW needs to address this, and not just in terms of student demand, but in terms of producing people with skills that are needed in our economy.  Let Evergreen be the go to place for a liberal arts education, they can&#039;t do what the UW can to produce people with real skills.

Second, tenure is protecting dead wood, not academic freedom.  If the UW really wants to be efficient, tenure has got to go, and with it faculty who can&#039;t teach or do original research.  If you genuinely want efficiency on the academic side of the house, and you want to demonstrate to the legislature that you&#039;re serious about change, abolish tenure.

Third, union seniority rules are the equivalent of tenure on the staff side.  The UW needs to start playing hardball with the unions and stop giving them whatever they want.  Unions, like tenure, protect dead wood and stifle change and creativity.

Whining to the legislature about the budget will continue to be futile so long as the UW declines to address real and systematic change.]]></description>
