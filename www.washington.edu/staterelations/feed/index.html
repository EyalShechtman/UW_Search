<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Sen. Lisa Wellman, chair of the Early Learning &amp; K-12 Education Committee, toured the UW <a href="https://haringcenter.org/">Haring Center for Inclusive Education </a>with Senate Democratic Caucus staff members, Heather Lewis-Lachner and Michael Althauser, and her legislative assistant, Noah Burgher. The Haring Center’s Principal Chris Matsumoto and Director Kathleen Artman Meeker led the tour, offering valuable insights into the Center’s work.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1964, the Haring Center has been committed to creating inclusive communities through early childhood education, professional development, and research. They currently serve nearly 180 children at their physical location, providing early support, preschool, and kindergarten classes where children with and without disabilities learn together in an inclusive, world-class environment.</p>
<p>The group had the opportunity to observe classrooms in action, as well as visit one classroom while the children were out at recess. They also toured various play and learning areas within the facility.</p>
<p>In addition to its educational programs, the Haring Center is at the forefront of research aimed at advancing inclusive learning. The Center develops best practices in inclusive education and shares this knowledge with communities and public schools throughout the state, helping to improve educational outcomes for children with and without disabilities.</p>
<p>The Haring Center also trains current and future educators. Undergraduate and graduate students in fields like education, social work, and occupational and speech therapy gain hands-on experience in inclusive classrooms. Furthermore, the Center provides professional development services to over 15,000 education professionals annually.</p>
<p>During the tour, the attendees had the opportunity to meet a current educator, as well as Ariane Gauvreau, the senior director of the Professional Development and Training Team, to learn more about the Center’s work in training and in-service development.</p>
<p>Thank you to Sen. Wellman, Heather, Michael, and Noah for taking the time to visit the Haring Center and learn about the impactful work being done to foster inclusivity in education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Secretary of State <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/about-office/news/2024/office-secretary-state-certifies-2024-general-election-results">certified</a> Washington’s general election results today. Voter turnout for the election was 79%, down from 84% in 2020, when the last presidential race was on the ballot.</p>
<p>The election results will keep Washington blue, with Democrats winning all of the partisan statewide executive races, as well as securing 60% majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>
<p>All nine statewide executive offices were up for election. Four races—Governor, Attorney General, Commissioner of Public Lands, and Insurance Commissioner—did not feature incumbent candidates on the ballot. The election results for the statewide offices are (*incumbent):</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor: Bob Ferguson</li>
<li>Lieutenant Governor: Denny Heck*</li>
<li>Secretary of State: Steve Hobbs*</li>
<li>State Treasurer: Mike Pellicciotti*</li>
<li>State Auditor: Pat McCarthy*</li>
<li>Attorney General: Nick Brown</li>
<li>Commissioner of Public Lands: Dave Upthegrove</li>
<li>Superintendent of Public Instruction: Chris Reykdal*</li>
<li>Insurance Commissioner: Patty Kuderer</li>
</ul>
<p>In the state legislature, all 98 seats in the Washington House of Representatives and 25 of the 49 Senate seats were on the ballot. Democrats gained a seat in each chamber, now holding 59 seats in the House and 30 seats in the Senate. With these 60% majorities, Democrats will be able to pass bond votes for the capital and transportation budgets without the support of Republicans. Historically, both budgets have been bipartisan.</p>
<p>Five newly elected Representatives are UW graduates: Rep. Natasha Hill (Legislative District 3-Spokane), Rep. Lisa Parshley (LD 22-Olympia), Rep. Adam Bernbaum (LD 24-Port Angeles), Rep. Michael Keaton (LD 25-Puyallup) and Rep. Adison Richards (LD 26-Kitsap County). They will join 24 UW alumni already in the Legislature. UW alumni make up almost 20% of the Senate and over 40% of the House of Representatives. For more information about the UW graduates who serve in state elected office, visit <u><a href="https://www.washington.edu/staterelations/uw-in-your-community/">UW in Your Community</a></u>.</p>
<p>Additionally, four initiatives appeared on the ballot, three of which were rejected:</p>
<ul>
<li>I-2066 – Passed. Concerns regulating energy services, including natural gas and electrification.</li>
<li>I-2109 – Rejected. Concerns taxes (capital gains).</li>
<li>I-2117 – Rejected. Concerns carbon tax credit trading.</li>
<li>I-2124 – Rejected. Concerns state long term care insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Washington voters decided one contested race for the Washington Supreme Court. In a tight race, Sal Mungia defeated Dave Larson.</p>
<p><strong>To view the final election results, visit the Secretary of State’s website <u><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/results.vote.wa.gov/results/20241105/__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!lweC6-fDE01L3ZKSXxHtWPxdt1nwiVQrQXn1O4WqVhU-pjeEOQtgyQjrH4FqODEf_Aw2DFQAmML42lA$">here</a></u>.</strong> For those also interested in the federal elections or activities at the national level, visit the <u><a href="https://www.washington.edu/federalrelations/">website</a></u> of the UW Office of Federal Relations.</p>
<p>Washington’s newly elected state officials will begin their terms on Jan. 13, when the 2025 legislative session begins. Over the course of the 105-day session, lawmakers will work to decide the state’s 2025-27 operating, capital, and transportation budgets.</p>
<p>This year in Olympia, the University of Washington will be focused on priorities critical to the University’s ability to serve students and employees, local industry, and communities across the state.

					<description><![CDATA[Washington’s projected revenue collections are down, according to the forecast released yesterday by the Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council. Projected general fund revenue for the current 2023-25 biennium, ending on June 30, 2025, is $66.39 billion, a decrease of $89 million from the September forecast. For the 2025-27 biennium, revenue is projected at $75.43 billion, down $181 million from September, while revenue for the 2027-29 biennium is forecasted at $72.85 billion, a reduction of $131 million.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Washington’s projected revenue collections are down, according to the <a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/meetings/rev20241120_0.pdf">forecast</a> released yesterday by the <a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/">Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council</a>.</p>
<p>Projected general fund revenue for the current 2023-25 biennium, ending on June 30, 2025, is $66.39 billion, a decrease of $89 million from the September forecast. For the 2025-27 biennium, revenue is projected at $75.43 billion, down $181 million from September, while revenue for the 2027-29 biennium is forecasted at $72.85 billion, a reduction of $131 million. In total, general fund revenue collections over the three biennia are projected to decrease by $401 million since the September forecast.</p>
<p>Forecasted revenue for the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA), which funds student financial aid and higher education priorities, has also declined slightly. The account is expected to decrease by $4 million in the current 2023-25 biennium, followed by further declines of $7.6 million in 2025-27 and $9.6 million in 2027-29. Estimated WEIA revenue for the 2025-27 biennium is $944.7 million, and it is projected to reach $1.019 billion in the 2027-29 biennium.</p>
<p>The slowdown in general fund revenue growth is attributed to lower retail sales and business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax forecasts. On a positive note, inflation and interest rates are trending downward, and forecasted collections from real estate excise, property, and liquor taxes have shown slight increases.</p>
<p>With overall revenue collections down, the Legislature is likely to face challenges developing the state budget. By law, the state is required to enact a balanced budget over the next two biennia. Governor Jay Inslee will release his budget proposals in mid-December, which must also balance over the four-year period. His proposals will provide insight into some of the tough decisions the state may need to consider in the development of the final budgets during the upcoming session.</p>
<p>The next revenue forecast will be released in mid-March, during the 2025 legislative session. With session scheduled to end on April 27, legislators will use both the March forecast and this one to inform their final budget decisions.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about the economic and revenue forecast, visit the Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council <a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/">website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Rep. Vandana Slatter and Sen. Joe Nguyen visited the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, where they engaged with students to learn about their academic and extracurricular achievements. The students shared their stories, highlighting their involvement in programs that support underrepresented and underserved communities in accessing and thriving in the fields of computer science and engineering.</p>
<p>Many of the students in attendance participated in Allen Scholars, a year-long cohort-based program supporting first-generation, low-income, and historically underserved students from Washington State who are pursuing degrees in computer science or computer engineering. This program has received support from the Washington State Legislature in recent years, helping to ensure its continued success. Others were involved in Changemakers in Computing, a program that seeks to increase participation of underrepresented and economically disadvantaged high school students in computer science. This initiative targets rising juniors and seniors in Washington State high schools to introduce them to computer science and engineering and prepare them for further study in the disciplines.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing their experiences in these programs, many students discussed their innovative research, roles as teaching assistants, and work as Allen School ambassadors. These ambassadors engage and build connections with K-12 students, inspiring the next generation by demonstrating that computer science and engineering are not only accessible but fields with opportunity and promise.</p>
<p>Hailing from various backgrounds and regions across Washington state, these students exemplify the future of the technology industry in Washington and beyond.</p>
<p>Rep. Slatter and Sen. Nguyen, both members of the Science, Technology, and Innovation Caucus, are passionate about advancing technology and innovation in Washington. Rep. Slatter chairs the Postsecondary &amp; Workforce Development Committee, while Sen. Nguyen chairs the Environment, Energy &amp; Technology Committee and serves as Vice Chair of the Ways &amp; Means Committee.</p>
<p>During their visit, the legislators engaged in meaningful conversations with the students about their academic journeys, their involvement in the Allen School’s programs, and how they are making an impact in their communities both now and in the future. The discussion also touched on advocacy, with students learning how to effectively communicate with lawmakers and about the state’s political process.</p>
<p>The discussion underscored the pivotal role that programs like Allen Scholars and Changemakers in Computing play in shaping a more inclusive and diverse technology workforce. It also provided a valuable opportunity for legislators and students to engage and share their unique perspectives and experiences with one another.</p>
<p>Thank you, Rep. Slatter and Sen. Nguyen, for your ongoing support of the UW and our students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Washington&#8217;s initial election results indicate that the state will remain deep-blue. Voters made decisions on statewide offices and initiatives, which will bring changes to the state&#8217;s political landscape.</p>
<p><strong>VOTER TURNOUT</strong><br />
Washington has more than 5 million registered voters and as of this evening, more than 74% of ballots have been returned and total voter turnout is at 58.5%. For reference, turnout in Washington was just over 84% in 2020, when the last presidential race was on the ballot.</p>
<p>Since Washington votes almost entirely by mail, votes are still being tabulated with an estimated 787,000 on hand to be counted. All ballots postmarked by Nov. 5 or dropped at an official ballot box by 8 p.m. on Nov. 5 will be counted.</p>
<p><strong>Up-to-date election results are available daily on the Secretary of State’s website <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20241105/default.htm">here</a>. </strong><em>Please note that the results included in this post were updated on the website on Nov. 6 at 6:28 p.m.</em></p>
<p>Final election results will be certified by the Secretary of State on or before Dec. 5.</p>
<p><strong>STATEWIDE EXECUTIVE RACES</strong><br />
All nine of Washington’s statewide offices were up for election in 2024, with four races—Governor, Attorney General, Commissioner of Public Lands, and Insurance Commissioner—featuring no incumbent candidates on the ballot.</p>
<p>Democrats are poised to win or have won all of the statewide offices. Here are the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governor: Bob Ferguson (D). </strong>Current Attorney General Bob Ferguson defeated former King County Sheriff and Congressman Dave Reichert (R). This was the first gubernatorial race in 12 years without an incumbent, as Gov. Jay Inslee chose not to seek re-election.</li>
<li><strong>Lieutenant Governor: Denny Heck* (D) </strong>defeated challenger Dan Matthews (R).</li>
<li><strong>Secretary of State: Steve Hobbs* (D) </strong>won against Dale Whitaker (R).</li>
<li><strong>State Treasurer: Mike Pellicciotti* (D) </strong>beat challenger Sharon Hanek (R).</li>
<li><strong>State Auditor: Pat McCarthy* (D) </strong>defeated Matt Hawkins (R).</li>
<li><strong>Attorney General: Nick Brown (D).</strong> In this open race, former U.S. Attorney Nick Brown won against Pasco Mayor Pete Serrano (R).</li>
<li><strong>Commissioner of Public Lands: Dave Upthegrove (D).</strong> In this open race, King County Council Chair Dave Upthegrove is ahead with 53.16% of the vote against former Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler (R).</li>
<li><strong>Superintendent of Public Instruction: Chris Reykdal* </strong>leads with 53.52% of the vote against David Olson.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance Commissioner: Patty Kuderer (D).</strong> In this open race, State Sen. Patty Kuderer won against her colleague, Sen. Phil Fortunato (R), who will return to the Senate to complete his term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*Incumbent</em></p>
<p>The results for the statewide executive races are <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20241105/stateexecutive.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LEGISLATIVE RACES</strong><br />
In addition to the statewide offices, all 98 seats in the Washington House of Representatives and 25 of the 49 Senate seats are up for election.</p>
<p>Democrats entered the election with strong majorities in both the House (58-40) and Senate (29-20) and early results suggest that these majorities are likely to grow. If Democrats win 59 seats in the House, they will secure a 60% supermajority, and the same will be true in the Senate if they win 30 seats.</p>
<p>Many races already have clear winners, but several are still too close to call, including:</p>
<p><strong>State Senate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legislative District 10 (Island County): </strong>Incumbent Sen. Ron Muzzall (R) is in a tight race with Janet St. Clair (D), with just 61 votes separating them. Muzzall has 49.89% of the vote, while St. Clair leads slightly with 49.99%.</li>
<li><strong>Legislative District 17 (Clark County):</strong> Paul Harris (R) is ahead with 50.65% of the vote against Marla Keethler (D), who has 49.24%.</li>
<li><strong>Legislative District 18 (Battle Ground):</strong> In this open seat, Adrian Cortes (D) is narrowly leading with 50.82% of the vote compared to Brad Benton, who has 49%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>State House</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legislative District 17 (Clark County):</strong> In the race to replace Rep. Paul Harris (R), who is running for the senate, Terri Niles (D) leads with 50.01% of the vote against David Stuebe (R), who has 49.86%</li>
<li><strong>Legislative District 18 (Battle Ground):</strong> In this open seat, John Ley (R) has a narrow lead with 50.1% of the vote against John Zingale, who has 49.75%.</li>

<p><strong>BALLOT INITIATIVES</strong><br />
Washington voters have rejected three of the four initiatives on the ballot, with the fourth still too close to call:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I-2066 – May Pass: 51.32% Yes, 46.68% No.</strong> Concerns regulating energy services, including natural gas and electrification. This measure would repeal or prohibit certain laws and regulations that discourage natural gas use and/or promote electrification, and require certain utilities and local governments to provide natural gas to eligible customers.</li>
<li><strong>I-2109 – Rejected.</strong> Concerns taxes (capital gains). This measure would repeal an excise tax imposed on the sale or exchange of certain long-term capital assets by individuals who have annual capital gains of over $250,000.</li>
<li><strong>I-2117 – Rejected.</strong> Concerns carbon tax credit trading. This measure would prohibit state agencies from imposing any type of carbon tax credit trading, and repeal legislation establishing a cap and invest program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li><strong>I-2124 – Rejected.</strong> Concerns state long term care insurance. This measure would require that employees and self-employed people must elect to keep coverage under the long-term services and supports trust program and could opt-out at any time. It would also repeal a law governing an exemption for employees.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>JUDICIAL RACES</strong><br />
Voters had three Washington Supreme Court justice races on the ballot, but only one featured two candidates. However, that race is proving to be a nail-biter, with Sal Mungia leading Dave Larson by a narrow margin of 49.84% to 49.66%.</p>
<p>There were also a number of Court of Appeals and county judge races on the ballot.</p>
<p>The judicial election results can be found <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20241105/judicial.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FEDERAL ELECTION RESULTS &#8211; WA STATE</strong><br />
At the federal level, Washington voters cast their ballots for a new President and for one of the state’s two Senate seats. Additionally, all ten of Washington’s House of Representative seats are up for election.</p>
<p><strong>President</strong><br />
Early Wednesday, Donald J. Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris did, however, secure Washington State’s electoral votes.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Senate</strong><br />
In the Senate race, incumbent Senator Maria Cantwell (D) defeated challenger Raul Garcia. However, the Senate will shift in 2025, with Senate Republicans flipping three seats and thereby gaining control of the chamber, taking over from the Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. House</strong><br />
In Washington&#8217;s House races, Democrat incumbent Reps. Suzan DelBene, Rick Larsen, Pramila Jayapal, Adam Smith, and Marilyn Strickland all secured new terms. While the race hasn’t officially been called, incumbent Rep. Kim Schrier (D) is also likely to be re-elected.</p>
<p>Additionally, Spokane County Treasurer Michael Baumgartner (R) and State Senator Emily Randall (D) were elected to Congress, succeeding retiring Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Derek Kilmer, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, the outcomes of the races for Congressional Districts 3 and 4 remain too close to call. In District 3, incumbent Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D) holds a narrow lead over challenger Joe Kent (R). Meanwhile, in District 4, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R) is leading against Jerrod Sessler (R) in a tightly contested race.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong><br />
Washington&#8217;s newly elected state officials will begin their terms on Jan. 13, coinciding with the start of the 2025 legislative session. During this long 105-day session, the state&#8217;s biennial operating, capital, and transportation budgets will be decided.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Senate Democrats will elect a new Majority Leader following the retirement of current Majority Leader Andy Billig. Legislators in both the House and Senate will also receive their committee assignments, which are expected to be announced before Assembly Days in the second week of December. Assembly Days serve as a “mini-session” for legislators to prepare for the full session ahead.</p>
<p>Also in December, Gov. Inslee will release his operating, capital, and transportation budget proposals, kicking off the budget process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the general election in Washington state, as well as across the nation. While national headlines may dominate the news, significant changes are set to take place at the state level where numerous offices and ballot measures are up for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Voting in Washington State</strong><br />
Washington has more than 5 million registered voters and so far, almost 57% of ballots have been returned.</p>
<p>Washington votes almost entirely by mail so all ballots postmarked by today or dropped off at an official ballot box by 8 p.m. will be counted. Additionally, individuals can still register to vote and cast their ballots in person by the same deadline.</p>
<p>The first election results will be posted on the Secretary of State’s <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/">website</a> tonight around 8 p.m. After today, daily updates will be available on the website after 5 p.m. Final results will be certified by the Secretary of State on or before Dec. 5.</p>
<p><em>For up-to-date election results, visit the Secretary of State’s website <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20241105/default.htm">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The Secretary of State’s <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections">elections page</a> offers comprehensive resources for voters, including voter eligibility and registration details, information about initiatives and referenda, voting data and research, and educational and outreach materials.</p>
<p><strong>Statewide Offices on the Ballot</strong><br />
All nine of Washington&#8217;s statewide executive positions are on the ballot this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor</li>
<li>Lieutenant Governor</li>
<li>Secretary of State</li>
<li>State Treasurer</li>
<li>State Auditor</li>
<li>Attorney General</li>
<li>Commissioner of Public Lands</li>
<li>Superintendent of Public Instruction</li>
<li>Insurance Commissioner</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, Washington will elect a new governor for the first time in 12 years, as Gov. Jay Inslee has opted not to seek reelection. The races for Attorney General, Commissioner of Public Lands, and Insurance Commissioner are also open, with no incumbents running.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Races</strong><br />
In addition to the statewide offices, all 98 seats in the Washington House of Representatives and 25 of the 49 Senate seats are up for election.</p>
<p>Currently, Democrats hold majorities in both the House (58-40) and Senate (29-20) and are likely to see their majorities expand. Additionally, next year will bring new faces to the legislature, with more than a dozen races featuring no incumbent candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Initiatives</strong><br />
Voters will also consider four statewide ballot initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>I-2066 concerns regulating energy services, including natural gas and electrification. This measure would repeal or prohibit certain laws and regulations that discourage natural gas use and/or promote electrification, and require certain utilities and local governments to provide natural gas to eligible customers.</li>
<li>I-2109 concerns taxes. This measure would repeal an excise tax imposed on the sale or exchange of certain long-term capital assets by individuals who have annual capital gains of over $250,000.</li>
<li>I-2117 concerns carbon tax credit trading. This measure would prohibit state agencies from imposing any type of carbon tax credit trading, and repeal legislation establishing a cap and invest program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>I-2124 concerns state long term care insurance. This measure would require that employees and self-employed people must elect to keep coverage under the long-term services and supports trust program and could opt-out at any time. It would also repeal a law governing an exemption for employees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judicial Elections</strong><br />
Voters will have the opportunity to elect three Washington State Supreme Court justices, although two of the races are unopposed. In addition, several Court of Appeals and county judge positions are on the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Federal Elections</strong><br />
At the federal level, Washington voters will cast their ballots for a new President and for one of the state’s two Senate seats. Additionally, all ten of Washington’s House of Representative seats are up for election.</p>
<p><em>For more details about the federal elections, visit the UW Office of Federal Relations’ <a href="https://www.washington.edu/federalrelations/">website</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br />
Washington’s newly elected state officials will assume office on the second Monday in January, coinciding with the start of the 2025 legislative session.</p>

<p>Last week, Rep. Steve Tharinger, Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, and legislative and gubernatorial staff visited UW Seattle for a briefing on and tour of the UW’s 2025 capital budget priorities. Attendees were briefed on the University’s long-term capital plan, campus asset renewal program, and recently completed or in progress capital projects.</p>
<p>UW staff then dove into the University’s 2025 capital budget requests:</p>
<p><strong>$</strong><strong>125M for the construction of a new Chemical Sciences Building and the strategic renovation of Bagley Hall. </strong>Constructed in 1937 and 1957, current Chemical Sciences facilities are overwhelmed by student demand and program constraints and do not meet the requirements for interdisciplinary, modern science education and research. Chemistry is a core program at UW and is required for students in most STEM and health science degree programs. Annually, chemistry teaches 68,000 student hours and current facilities serve more than 18,000 students. Additionally, chemical sciences research fuels discoveries and innovation in clean energy, quantum, artificial intelligence, and more. New facilities will help meet course demand and increase degree production, improve interdisciplinary learning, attract and retain world-class faculty, increase federal grant funding for cutting-edge research, and strengthen relationships with industry partners, and grow workforce pipelines.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #3d3d3d">$292.6M in Climate Commitment Account funding for 10 projects to support the transition to 100% clean energy at UW Seattle. </strong><span style="color: #3d3d3d">The UW is diligently working through a comprehensive </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff" href="https://sustainability.uw.edu/energy-transformation">five-part strategy</a><span style="color: #3d3d3d"> to decarbonize the energy systems on the Seattle campus. This is a monumental undertaking, particularly because UW Seattle’s current energy system has served the campus for 100+ years, is capacity-constrained, and no longer aligns with sustainability goals. The UW seeks funding to support the first 10 projects outlined in the clean energy strategy, which will help modernize the UW’s energy infrastructure, propel long-term decarbonization efforts, and enhance compliance with state and local regulations.</span></p>
<p>After the briefing, legislators and staff toured Bagley Hall and the Chemical Sciences Library, including classrooms and labs. Throughout the tour, they had the opportunity to connect with current students and faculty and learn from them about their studies, research, and needs for the new facilities.</p>
<p>For detailed information about the UW’s 2025 capital budget requests, see our <a href="https://ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/budget/statebudget/2025-27capitalrequests/360-UW-2025-27biennial.pdf">decision packages</a> on the Washington State Office of Financial Management <a href="https://ofm.wa.gov/budget/state-budgets/capital-budget-requests">website</a>. The UW Office of State Relations will also post the University’s 2025 legislative agenda later this fall.</p>
<p>Thank you to Sen. Yasmin Trudeau and Rep. Steve Tharinger, as well as John Wilson-Tepeli, Kate Henry, Michael Bezanson, Alec Osenbach, Kelsey Rote, and Ramona Nabors, for visiting the UW and for your continued support!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the UW partnered with the Chehalis Foundation to host our annual local STEM camp for incoming 9th-12th graders focused on medicine and engineering science.</p>
<p>The students explored healthcare simulation today with experts from the UW WWAMI Institute for Simulation in Healthcare (WISH). They learned how technology, art, and science intersect to create innovative learning experiences for medical students and healthcare workers. The students then got hands-on experience designing their own simulations and competed in a Simulations Olympics against one another.</p>
<p>Reps. Peter Abbarno and Ed Orcutt, who represent the 20th legislative district which includes Chehalis, stopped by to engage with the students and watch them battle in the Simulation Olympics. They even took a turn at the simulations.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the camp, the students will focus on engineering by exploring forms of energy like heat and motion with UW faculty in the College of Engineering. The students will then put their knowledge and skills to the test in an engineering design competition.</p>
<p>Thank you, Reps. Abbarno and Orcutt, for taking the time to connect with local high school students and UW faculty.<br />
