<h3>Resources</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of the Title IX Coordinator</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW policies</a> prohibiting sex- and gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/supportive-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supportive measures</a> and <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting options</a> for survivors</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/employee-reporting-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX Employee reporting rules</a> including who is a mandatory reporter</p>
</div>
<p>Everything that our great public University does together – learning, research, public service, community engagement and patient care – depends on a foundation of respect, inclusion and safety for all. Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex- and gender-based discrimination in educational institutions, is the baseline – but not the ceiling – for how we build and maintain an environment that does not tolerate sexual assault, sexual harassment or gender-based harassment or discrimination. The responsibility for creating that environment is shared by all of us. Our University has and will continue to ensure that, through our <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of the Title IX Coordinator</a>, every member of our community has the information, resources, tools and support systems to make the UW welcoming, equitable and safe.</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing work to make it easier for everyone to get questions answered and access help , the Title IX Office has expanded its services, including a new team of dedicated and experienced case managers. Our case managers are skilled at helping staff, faculty and students navigate resources and options related to sex- and gender-based discrimination, harassment and violence. They are able to help whether you are seeking <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/supportive-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supportive measures</a>, a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/resolution-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution to an issue</a>, or simply want information.  They also provide  <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/pregnant-parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for </a>students who are pregnant  or experiencing related conditions. For employees or students who aren’t sure how to handle a concern, please <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact them</a> – they are here to help you figure it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Title IX online reporting form</a>, which launched last year, has proven to be an easy way for students, faculty and staff to request support, understand their options and share information with the Title IX Office, and we’re pleased to see that the tool is working as designed. It’s important to know that the form allows for anonymous reporting, and to be aware that confidential support is available through <a href="https://www.washington.edu/sexualassault/support/advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Confidential Advocates</a> on all three campuses.</p>
<p>This year, the Title IX Office also launched a new <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/resolution-options/alternative-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) option</a> for students. ADR is a voluntary, informal process designed to help parties reach mutually agreeable solutions, and it’s now available for resolving allegations of Title IX-related policy violations.</p>
<p>Finally, as you may already be aware, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/2024/08/01/implementation-of-2024-title-ix-regulations-at-uw-blocked-by-federal-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal court issued an injunction which halted the implementation of new Title IX rules</a> at UW and many schools across the nation. While this has created some uncertainty, the 2020 Title IX regulations and related laws, Washington state law, and UW policy remain in place. Above all, nothing will diminish our commitment to upholding the protections of Title IX and to the broader work of promoting a safe and equitable environment for all students, including protections against discrimination and harassment for LGBTQ+ members of our community.</p>
<p>Throughout my decades in academia and as a member of the UW community, I have seen first-hand how important it is not only to individual success, but institutional success to create a workplace culture that is free from gender-based discrimination and misconduct. I see my personal commitment reflected throughout our extraordinary community, I know that we will all do our part to make the University the welcoming, supportive and equitable place we want it to be.</p>

<p>This coming Tuesday, November 5, our nation will participate in one of the most important events in the life of a healthy democracy: electing our leaders and representatives, including, of course, the next U.S. president. As we approach the election, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the stress and anxiety that many are feeling in what has been an undeniably polarizing and divisive campaign season. Regardless of the outcome of this election, our democratic values and principles matter, and our participation in the democratic process is essential.</p>
<p>For those who are eligible, voting is not just a right, it’s our opportunity to shape the future of our communities, our state and our nation. In Washington, we are voting both on candidates for office and on state and local ballot measures, and I hope you will take time to learn about the candidates and issues and cast your vote. If you need information about how to cast your vote, <a href="https://voter.votewa.gov/portal2023/login.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the Washington voter portal.</a></p>
<p>If you are experiencing stress or anxiety about the election—or for any reason—know that resources and support are available. You can find links in the info box to mental health and counseling resources. Also remember to practice good self-care, to step away from screen time and social media if you need to, and to check in with the people you care about and who care about you.</p>
<p>As a University devoted to learning and discovery and to fostering discussion and debate, I encourage you to watch the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/provost/2024election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy in Focus lecture series</a>, sponsored by Provost Tricia Serio, which explores some of the most important aspects of the democratic process. And I invite you to participate in the November 7 town hall, <a href="https://evans.uw.edu/event/trust-on-the-ballot-voting-in-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Trust on the Ballot: Voting in Washington,&#8221;</a> hosted by the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Evans School for Public Policy &amp; Governance, which will feature three current and former Washington secretaries of state in a discussion of the history and evolution of voting in our state.</p>
<p>As a community, we will always cultivate learning, discovery and discussion that supports a thriving democracy and civic engagement. And we will continue to be a community that supports one another and lifts each other up as we work to serve the public interest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The 2023 Economic Impact Report found that the UW generated $20.9 billion in combined economic impact in FY23, making it unquestionably one of the best public investments the state of Washington makes in its people, economy and future. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our University’s public mission shows up in countless ways – in communities across Washington, in the lives of students and their families, in the learning and discovery led by our faculty, and in the treatment and care that UW Medicine provides to tens of thousands of patients. It’s not always easy to quantify the true scope of the UW’s impact, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/10/30/eir2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but as <span data-contrast="auto">a new independently produced report shows</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, the UW is unquestionably one of the best public investments the state of Washington makes in its people, economy and future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/externalaffairs/eir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 2023 Economic Impact Report</a>, produced by the Parker Strategy Group, found that the UW generated $20.9 billion in combined economic impact in FY23, accounting for more than 3% of the entire Washington state economy. That figure grew by more than $5 billion <a href="https://www.washington.edu/president/2019/11/19/economic-impact-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since our last Economic Impact Report produced in 2019</a>. Based on the University’s total economic impact, for every for every $1 in funding invested by the state legislature, the UW generates over $28 for Washington’s economy.</p>
<p>The study measured the economic contribution of the UW’s operations including our campuses and projects across the state of Washington as well as individual impact analyses of UW Medicine, the five-state WWAMI Medical Education Program, the UW’s research enterprise, UW Athletics, alumni of the university and CoMotion. It also highlights the impact of faculty, staff and student volunteerism and charitable giving. <span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p>Among the highlights: the UW supports and sustains 111,951 jobs in Washington state. Through the University’s local spending and the spending of its employees, students, and visitors, the UW contributed an estimated $962.6 million to local and state governments and their communities via tax revenue. And UW Medicine alone produced $12.5 billion in economic impact, including $836 million in under- or uncompensated, high-quality patient care. The UW School of Medicine also trains thousands of doctors who now practice in our state and, through WWAMI, thousands more are practicing across Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho, many in severely underserved areas.<span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p>The report’s findings provide important evidence to the public we serve and the elected officials who represent us about how much the UW contributes to healthy people, communities and the economy in Washington. It reflects the value of public investment in our public serving institution and underscores the importance of continued investment for the benefit of all. Our University exists to serve the public, and thanks to this study, we can see clearly how our public service mission is delivering across Washington. <span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p>Today we learned that <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/biochemistry/faculty/david-baker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none">UW Medicine Professor of Biochemistry David Baker</span></a><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"> was</span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"> awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry</span></a><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"> (with co-winners Demis Hassabis and John M.

<p><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/the-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-is-being-awarded-in-stockholm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none">This award makes David the eighth UW faculty member to win a Nobel Prize,</span></a><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"> a testament to the visionary and talented individuals who are drawn here to research, teach and mentor. In addition to holding the Henrietta and Aubrey Davis Endowed Chair in Biochemistry, David is the Director of the </span><a href="https://www.ipd.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none">Institute for Protein Design</span>.</a><span xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"> But it&#8217;s notable that he also holds adjunct appointments in bioengineering, genome sciences, physics, chemical engineering and computer science. This reflects the kind of interdisciplinary cross-pollination that supports breakthrough discoveries like the work he is leading. This collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is a huge part of what draws the world’s most talented students, postdocs, faculty and others to David’s lab and the many other centers of discovery and innovation at our great public University. </span></p>
<p>David’s visionary exploration has helped revolutionize the field of protein design, and he and his team are developing new proteins to address some of the most pressing problems we face as a species and a planet. Potential applications for designed proteins range from new vaccines, antivirals and cancer treatments; to new ways of sequestering carbon and harmful greenhouse gasses; to breaking down environmental pollutants, among many others.</p>
<p>Through this kind of work, the Institute for Protein Design epitomizes our University’s commitment to discovery that creates and accelerates impact for the public good. David’s achievements underscore what is possible at the intersection of curiosity-driven research and translating basic research into real world impact, helping to attract the next generation of talented researchers to the UW. It also shows how powerful public and private investment – through government grants and philanthropic support – can be in advancing scientific discovery.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize is the latest of many prestigious honors awarded to David for his scientific contributions, including the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and being named among TIME’s 100 Most Influential People in Health. He is also a Seattle native, a graduate of Garfield High School, and he is the son of not one, but two UW faculty members!</p>
<p>I know you will join me in congratulating David on this incredible honor, and in celebrating the impact of his achievements in expanding human knowledge and progress for a healthier, more sustainable world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="info-box info-box-large">
<h3>Annual President’s Address</h3>
<p>Join President Cauce for her annual address to the UW community about her priorities for her last year in office and the role of higher education in strengthening a democratic society through learning and discovery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/president/address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tune in via livestream on Tuesday, Oct. 15 </a><br />
10:00 a.m. &#8211; 11:00 a.m.</p>
</div>
<p>The start of every academic year is a special time for us all, representing both an opportunity for the renewal of work in progress and for new beginnings. Our community’s extraordinary capacity to transform our world for the better through learning, discovery, caregiving and creating opportunity has been, and continues to be a constant source of inspiration and wonder.</p>
<p>The University of Washington was built to endure, and the responsibility for sustaining and evolving our great public university falls to each new generation of students, faculty and staff. That responsibility now lies with us, and together, we can confront the many challenges our world faces including the deepening polarization throughout our society with empathy, collaboration and dialogue across our differences.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.washington.edu/president/2024/09/16/community-expectations-and-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared with our community last week</a>, it’s important to understand that the UW is a part of society, and home to the same disagreements and conflicting perspectives as the rest of the world. What distinguishes our University is not that we are – or should be – insulated from challenging ideas, but that we come together to learn how to navigate those disagreements in productive ways. This means having both safe spaces, where people can be with those who are like-minded, and brave spaces, where we engage with each other across our differences in civil discourse on controversial topics. In doing so, all of us are <a href="https://www.washington.edu/freespeech/student-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to live up to our community’s standard</a>s and values by creating a culture that is welcoming, inclusive and respectful.</p>
<p>We are taking a number of actions to support a welcoming and inclusive environment that upholds our fundamental rights to <a href="https://www.washington.edu/freespeech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free speech and expression</a>, while making clear the time, place, and manner restrictions necessary to ensure that we can all pursue our primary missions of teaching and learning, discovery, health care delivery, and service to our communities. We will also be requiring all events using campus spaces to be registered under our <a href="https://www.washington.edu/freespeech/events-and-use-of-university-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Use of University Facilities policy</a> in line with our <a href="https://www.washington.edu/safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety planning</a>. These expectations are being communicated to members of our community in orientation sessions throughout the week. These and other actions are part of our commitment to maintaining a safe, inclusive environment for every member of our community.</p>
<p>As I wrote last week, every member of the UW community was chosen from a pool of highly qualified applicants because each of us has important ideas and skills that can make our community and the world a better place. To fulfill that mission, we must be a community that is able to consider and evaluate different perspectives, opinions and beliefs, and listen to competing ideas. These skills are critical to the learning, scholarship, research, and community service and engagement that we came here to be part of. But it all begins with empathy and respect for our shared humanity.</p>
<p>Provost Tricia Serio has launched the <a href="https://dialogue.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Dialogue Initiative</a> to promote learning environments that encourage curiosity, openness, critical thinking, active listening, productive dialogue and shared responsibility. And Dean of Undergraduate Affairs Ed Taylor is leading a new undergraduate course, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/uaa/academic-resources/2024-dialogue-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“2024: Dialogue, Disagreement and Democracy,”</a> to help students develop the skills to navigate differences and have productive conversations, because the same skills that lead to scientific breakthroughs, innovation and knowledge creation also support stronger democracies and bolster civil liberties.</p>
<p>We face big, complex challenges – from climate change and the rise of AI, to devastating wars and global threats to democracy, to inequities in health, wealth, educational access and more. All of us were drawn here because we share a conviction that we can make a difference in the world, and if we work together, we can and we will. I’ll be talking more about how we can reach those goals as an institution and a community at my Annual President’s Address on October 15.</p>
<p>I’m excited for the year ahead and looking forward to continuing our shared mission. Welcome to the new academic year – let’s do great work together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we begin another year full of learning, discovery and service to community, I want to reiterate the obligations we have to our community, and to each other, to enable that tradition to continue – especially in light of the discord and conflict we are experiencing in our nation and across the globe. Without question, the freedom to engage in political speech and social activism are cornerstones of our democracy and part of a rich tradition on colleges campuses, including our own.</p>
<p>The UW is a part of society – not a refuge from it – and our community experiences many of the same disagreements and competing perspectives that exist throughout our pluralistic society. Being exposed to ideas that challenge us and our beliefs is important for our learning and growth. Sometimes, ideas that we disagree with may offend us, or even be hurtful. That, too, is part of living in a democratic society that values and makes room for different perspectives, opinions and beliefs. It is necessary for us all to learn how to communicate across our differences, and how to handle disagreements with empathy, courage and resilience, in order to effectively navigate the complexities of our world. Our University should be a place for all of us to engage in reasoned dialogue on the issues about which we are most passionate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="info-box">

<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/freespeech/">Free Expression and Community Standards</a></p>
</div>
<p>However, the freedom to express opinions fully, while knowing that some will disagree with them, is not a license to intimidate or threaten others. Nor does it entitle anyone to disrupt the pursuit of our mission of learning, teaching, research, health care and public service. For example, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/09/12/statement-on-uw-board-of-regents-meeting-disruption-and-adjournment/">at last week’s Board of Regents meeting</a>, we experienced just such disruptive conduct that went against our policies and our communities’ standards.</p>
<p>After public commenters spoke to the Board about contentious labor issues and in favor of divestment from companies operating in Israel without interruption, several members of the Jewish community then spoke in opposition to divestment and regarding their views on the climate for Jewish students and employees. They were repeatedly interrupted and even shouted down by some protestors. The disruptive conduct continued despite multiple warnings to stop, which forced the Board to adjourn its meeting, thus disrupting important University business. UWPD continues to investigate the incident and there has already been one arrest, of a man with no apparent UW affiliation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/freespeech/">Our policies and expectations</a> apply to UW community members and to individuals coming to the University. For example, in addition to prohibitions against disruptive behavior, whether or not it is discriminatory, the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/freespeech/student-conduct/">UW Student Code of Conduct</a> prohibits harassment of all kinds, including racist, sex- or gender-based, antisemitic, Islamophobic, ableist and other discriminatory behavior. We expect every student to live up to that code as a condition of their enrollment. We have similar expectations of our faculty and staff as a condition of their employment, and of individuals from outside the UW who come to our campuses, meetings and events. Any conduct that targets individuals or groups in ways that create a hostile environment is unacceptable. This includes behavior in classrooms and labs, workplaces, residence halls, and public meetings and spaces.</p>
<p>These principles that inform our campus culture have been and will continue to be clearly communicated to students during <a href="https://www.washington.edu/newhuskies/your-orientation/">New Husky Orientation</a> and in the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/studentlife/category/messages-to-the-community/">Husky Pawket Guide from our Office of Student Life</a>. We will be offering a new course, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/uaa/academic-resources/2024-dialogue-course/">“2024: Dialogue, Disagreement and Democracy,”</a> to help students develop the skills to navigate differences and have productive conversations. We will also be communicating these principles to faculty and staff in appropriate venues.</p>
<p>Last year, our Seattle campus, like many others across the U.S., experienced disruptions by protests against the ongoing war in Gaza. This fall also coincides with the final stretch of a contentious and heated presidential election in our country. Peaceful protest is allowed and free speech is integral to our society. If protest actions do occur on campus, we will evaluate their adherence to these principles on a case-by-case basis, with safety as our North Star. Peaceful protests can be a positive, constructive part of our educational mission. Moreover, as a public university we cannot close off our campus from other members of the public; in fact, we welcome their participation in the many cultural, artistic and community activities that take place on our campus. But, if and when protest activities become disruptive, inciting or are accompanied by the destruction of public resources, we will first and foremost take action to protect people’s physical safety. We will also take whatever action is necessary and appropriate to allow the University to continue operations and serve our teaching, research and service mission. This includes enabling all community members to use public spaces and facilities appropriately and without being harassed or threatened.</p>
<p>Every member of the UW community was chosen from a pool of highly qualified applicants because each of us has important ideas and skills that can contribute to the <em>public good</em>. When we treat each other with empathy, respect and civility, we create the conditions necessary for this to happen, and in doing so, we strengthen our society.</p>
<p>I love this University, and I have deep faith in our capacity to collectively advance learning, discovery knowledge and healing that serves to advance a more just, peaceful and prosperous world. That mission depends on all of us committing to listening across our differences, considering disparate points of view and remembering that we always owe each other respect, civility and the benefit of the doubt, even in cases where we disagree. Violent rhetoric, intimidation and vandalism do not win over people to a cause – listening, sharing and seeking out common ground are the powerful tools that can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, the University of Washington officially takes its place in the Big Ten Conference, and throughout our community of students, coaches, faculty, staff and alumni, the excitement is palpable! It has been a remarkable journey to reach this milestone, and I’m so grateful for all the hard work, collaboration and leadership that has gone into transitioning the UW and Husky Athletics to the highest-profile national stage in college sports. I can’t wait to watch as our outstanding teams and student-athletes – not to mention fans – show the world what it means to be a Husky.</p>
<p>One of the most rewarding parts of joining the Big Ten is that even as we compete against new opponents on the court and the field (including the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“other” UW</a>), we will continue to square off against many of the West Coast teams with whom we have long-standing and celebrated rivalries. Of course this includes the Ducks, but we’ll also remain in a conference with USC and UCLA, which have traditionally produced some of the most thrilling and enjoyable match-ups for Husky fans. It also gives me great pleasure to know that the Apple Cup tradition will continue, which is good news for all Washington sports fans whether they wear crimson or purple.</p>
<p>The transition to the Big Ten has also opened numerous doors for our academic community to forge new partnerships and collaborations with other conference universities, almost all of which are, like the UW, members of the <a href="https://www.aau.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of American Universities (AAU)</a>, a group of the nation’s leading research universities. These opportunities for academic research alignment include the <a href="https://btaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a> as well as the <a href="https://bigtencrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium</a>, which is doing incredible work in advancing cancer research and patient care. As a national leader in cancer research and treatment, UW Medicine is primed to be part of this powerful collaboration.</p>
<p>What is clear from the past few years is how dynamic the college sports landscape is, with many unanswered questions about how academic institutions and student-athletes will navigate the shifting terrain. At the UW, we lead with our values and our commitment to developing student-athletes who thrive not only in competition, but in the classroom and throughout their lives. As a Big Ten member, the UW will have a prominent voice in ensuring that the future of college sports honors and upholds those values for the good of all student-athletes, present and future.</p>
<p>So, this fall, as our <a href="https://gohuskies.com/calendar">soccer, football, volleyball and cross country teams begin their seasons</a>, I am overjoyed to be rooting for all of our Dawgs, and to be sustaining so many of our beloved traditions while also experiencing the thrill of a new and bigger stage. And whether you’re part of the roaring crowd or cheering from your couch, I hope you’ll join me in saying GO DAWGS!</p>

Progress for LGBTQIA+ rights – including the right to celebrate who we are in all our incredible diversity – has marched forward since I first arrived here in 1986; at that time, I certainly wouldn’t have believed that an openly gay woman could aspire to the role of UW president. But the 50</span><span data-contrast="auto"><sup>th</sup></span><span data-contrast="auto"> anniversary of Seattle Pride is a warm reminder that even as far back as the 1800s, </span><a href="https://seattlepride.org/timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">the gay community in Seattle has carved out space for people to live authentically</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and that enduring legacy is a part of why I love my home so much. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Today, we are fortunate to benefit from the bravery and sacrifice of all the LGBTQIA+ pioneers throughout history and all over the world who fought against discrimination. And we can honor their legacy by continuing to work for acceptance, equality, dignity and safety for every person regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. While Seattle may be a largely safe space for people to live and work without fear, there are many places where that is not the case, and indeed, where efforts are underway to make it less comfortable and safe for marginalized people to live openly or authentically.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a University, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that our campuses and communities are welcoming  places in which students, faculty, staff, friends, neighbors and visitors can be themselves. For many UW students, our campuses are the most diverse place they’ve yet experienced, and a fundamental part of the Husky Experience is finding pathways for self-discovery. For LGBTQIA+ students, that journey can be as complicated as it is liberating, and we work to ensure that resources like the </span><a href="https://sites.uw.edu/qcenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">Q Center</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and the </span><a href="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/lgbtq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">Office of the Title IX Coordinator</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are available to support them in finding community and feeling a sense of belonging.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The phrase “Pride Month” evolved in the wake of the Stonewall Protests as gay rights activists explicitly rejected the notion that anyone had to be ashamed of being themselves</span><span data-contrast="auto">. This radical-at-the-time idea has been a transformative and liberating force for countless people, including me. This Pride Month, I hope we can all take pride in being members of a community that recognizes difference as a strength and welcomes people for who they truly are. Our UW community is one that I am deeply proud to be a part of as we continue the work of making the world welcoming and safe for all people. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For almost 40 years, the University of Washington has been my home, and our shared mission of education, discovery, health care and impact for the public good has been my purpose. Next year, when my second five-year term concludes, I plan to step down from the role of president and return to my faculty position. There are several University priorities I want to advance over the coming year, and I’m going to spend that time fully focused on those efforts. I’m sharing this news — which I have long planned in partnership with the UW’s Board of Regents — to ensure a smooth leadership transition when the time comes.</p>
<p>Serving as president of the UW is a joy and a privilege, including through some very tumultuous periods and transformative events that have shaped our University and our world. I’m incredibly proud of the amazing impact that UW faculty, staff, students and alumni create throughout our community, state and world, and I’m deeply grateful to be a Husky.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ana Mari Cauce announces her final year as UW&#039;s president" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgGVqUbo7MM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Our world faces serious challenges, including here in Washington. The UW is a vital resource that prepares students for professional opportunities and lives that change the world. In the coming year, I will continue to focus on ensuring and expanding educational access for students across our state, regardless of their background or resources. This will also be an important year in the evolution of our “impact ecosystem.” By leveraging our interdisciplinary expertise, research and innovation in collaboration with business, government and community organizations, our University is uniquely positioned to tackle challenges like population health, climate change and inequality, and I will be working to solidify and advance this work. And as a public university, we rely on public support to fuel our public mission, and so I will also be focused on advocating for forward-looking investment in students and our institution by the state legislature in the coming year’s budget session.</p>
<p>There will be time for farewells later. My energy, enthusiasm and attention are squarely focused on our public mission and on the students, patients and communities the UW has served for so many generations. Throughout the remainder of my term – and my life – I will do everything in my power to ensure the UW continues to support learning, discovery and service now and for all the generations to come.</p>
