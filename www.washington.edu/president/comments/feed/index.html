					<description><![CDATA[I wonder of the validity of President Young&#039;s stance of community improvement in Washington. 

First, the Washington legislature can only concern themselves with Washington&#039;s economic future while keeping an eye on the national and global economic horizons. How many of the international students who UW teaches plan on sticking around once they complete their formal studies? 

I agree that the 18% or so the state has been paying for the total operations of UW is a pittance and a poor investment. But, Young&#039;s contention that the legislature&#039;s proposal is an investment in Washington&#039;s future based on his points falls flat with me. 

Perhaps admitting that UW is a major player in the sustainment of an idealogical, economic and educational port of entry in the state would ring less hollow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear President Young,

I have served on the faculty of the UW for over 30 years, and seen many presidents and provosts come and go.  I count President Emeritus Lee Huntsman among my friends; others I have known less well.  I add my thoughts to those of the many who have already spoken out.

I strongly support the selection of Ana Mari Cauce as our next Provost.  Even a national search would not likely find a better qualified person than Ana Mari.

This choice, though excellent, and the minimal process you have added at the last minute, in no way mitigates the truly gross disrespect you have shown the UW faculty in the conduct of the final stages of the search process.  I strongly urge you to take every opportunity going forward to carefully follow and reinforce the UW administration&#039;s commitment to the principles of shared governance and respect for the Faculty Code, along with other fundamental principles on which this university has become one of the greatest in our nation and in the world.  You, not Ana Mari, must take the lead on this, though past experience suggests that she can provide you much good insight from her years of successful experience here.

You have a huge opportunity still before you.  More than ever, we need you to help keep the UW strong and focused on our mission of researh, teaching and service, in the face of budgetary and other attacks.  If you don&#039;t do it, who will?  If not now, when?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Young;
Thank you for the consideration you have shown for the UW community by honoring the highly effective process for Provost search, focusing on an internal search, and for trusting us with an announcement of your Preferred Candidate.
Dr. Cauce&#039;s scientific, instructional, and administrative experience at UW and throughout the psychology, ethnicity, and higher education communities should stand her in excellent stead to make a tremendous future contribution to the UW and her emerging future missions.
Thank you for identifying such a deserving and capable candidate, with vision.
No reply necessary.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a first generation, female non-traditional student, who also has native american ancestors (Cherokee, Blackfoot &#038; Crow. I returned to school after decades of employment, raising a family, much community service and being ousted out of my hard earned socio-economic position by the recently ruled to be unconstitutional acts of past thoughtless King County council members.
Some of those key players are now in WA. DC. helping to eliminate the middle class nationally. Finding myself stripped of assets nearly 5 years ago, I chose to mitigate my grief in the most positive way I could create- I chose to go back to school and get a fresh education to attach to my lifetime of experience.  Having no family preceding generation of family follow their examples into academia and a midst the criticism of many in and out of academia my husband and children most excepted)I re-entered post High school academia. Hummnnn, &quot;Obama wants moms to go back to school&quot;...I do not qualify for that funding stuff - just so you know.  I am a taxpayer, a lifetime Washington state resident and I had earned a 3.9 GPA (I constantly surprise even myself)when I applied to transfer to the UW. I earned my slot to study at the UW.  Yet, I have sensed intentional and unintentional discouragement, withholding of opportunities and basically being &quot;counted out&quot;.  Until I spoke with you at the community reception I was merely a sense that I worked hard to believe was prejudice/ bigotry directed my way.  Thank you for being honest and so articulately validating my surmise when you stated, &quot;Research University demographics to not support the viability of Non-traditional and disabled students&quot;...I might state that in true empirical research.. sometimes the solutions can be found in the outliers. If researchers only looks at what they want to look at (of course it is easier to analyze) than they may miss a solution that has not yet been found. Can you explain to me and others who fit into academic categories such as those I qualify for...what you meant by that response? Those of us with visible and in my case recently diagnosed hidden disabilities which (I struggle to better manage and yet) are federally protected populations. We have much to offer and because of our life experiences we ARE able to connect the dots where others may not. Please don&#039;t count us out before we have a chance to contribute just because &quot;demographics say they do not support us&quot; and because so many people prejudiciously do.  If you are looking for a part of the academic community who can help &quot;connect the dots&quot;  I would suggest that we have that capability because we have spent a life time thinking out of the box!&quot;.  I puzzle as to why after I waited so patiently until all others even those who stepped in with out waiting to speak to you tried to ignore me and leave before we had the opportunity to chat.  Then why when I said, but I&#039;ve been waiting to ask you a couple of burning questions...did you say to me.. &quot;Ok, 30 seconds, ask your question&quot;.  I did not observe you be so dismissing with anyone else who wanted to speak with you.  Perhaps, you were tired or there is some other reason for your disappointing interaction.  So, I am hoping to have you think through your response this time around. Please justify to me and others in my categories why we should simply accept such dismissive responses.  Sincerly &#038; Respectfully, MarLa Kepler

How important do you feel it is for undergraduates to be engaged in their community in ways that connect back to their academic studies?  (Ie. civic engagement or service learning)
