<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>Tell us about your background and experience.</strong></footer>
<p>I was born and raised in Taiwan. From an early age, I knew I wanted to explore more of the world. I chose geography as my field of study when I went to National Taiwan University. I really enjoyed all of the field components of the curriculum, especially going out to explore different topics across various regions in Taiwan. While I was in university, I took advantage of an opportunity to go on a new global exchange program to Germany. The language program allowed me to study German intensively for three months in Munich. In my senior year, I decided to study abroad again but this time in Australia on an exchange program to the <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Melbourne</a>. My first few weeks in Australia were very difficult as I figured out how to navigate a different system of higher education and I gained more confidence to speak out during class discussions.</p>
<p>After I graduated from university, I spent one month in Taiwan after returning from Australia before I packed up all of my things and moved to Madison, Wisconsin. I came to the United States in 2003 to continue studying geography in graduate school. While I was in graduate school, I served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses in my department. It was a very formative experience for me. I learned more about what higher education looks like in the United States. I found a way to deliver instructions to students in my class while sharing my own perspectives. It involved a lot of self preparation and learning from my peers and mentors to learn how to adopt a more interactive teaching style.</p>
<p>My first job after graduate school was in the <a href="https://envstudies.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Program on the Environment</a> in the <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">College of the Environment</a> at the University of Washington back in 2013. For the first couple of years, I mainly focused on developing curriculum and learning the curriculum in my program. In 2017 or 2018, after establishing some of my teaching credentials in my program, I decided to incorporate more of an global learning component into our curriculum. I saw there was a demand from students in the Program on the Environment to learn more about environmental issues in countries outside of the Western context. I decided to challenge myself and started seeking opportunities to bring in an international perspective to our curriculum. I got started by making connections with colleagues in Taiwan to lay the groundwork for a new study abroad program.</p>

<p>I chose to focus my faculty-led <a href="https://www.washington.edu/studyabroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Study Abroad</a> program on environmental and social resilience in Taiwan because it is a strong example of how societies can recover from environmental and social disasters. I thought it would be an interesting opportunity for UW students to see how a dynamic country like Taiwan has learned to cope with their unique environmental and social challenges. Taiwan is an active tectonic region due to its location at the intersection of several tectonic plates. Taiwan experiences very strong earthquakes as well as all kinds of severe weather, from typhoons to storms to flooding. However, Taiwanese societies are incredibly resilient and learn to rebuild themselves after each disaster. There is a strong network to detect and monitor disasters and first responders are always very quick to to act whenever they are needed. There is also a strong emphasis on environmental education, starting in the K to 12 education system and continuing into higher education.</p>
<p>It took a while to design my study abroad program. It&#8217;s not just about developing the curriculum but it&#8217;s also about figuring out the field trips, the guest lectures, the itinerary, the lodging, the transportation and the other logistics. However, I am very fortunate to remain in close contact with some of my colleagues from when I studied at National Taiwan University. Many of them now work in different parts of the island for different institutions of higher education. I connected with them by asking them questions such as, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on in your part of Taiwan?&#8221; and &#8220;What are some of the unique topics you feel would be valuable for American students to experience?&#8221;.</p>

<p>I ultimately designed my study abroad program to bring 15-20 undergraduate UW students from a wide variety of majors to three main locations across the west coast of Taiwan. </blockquote><figcaption>Dr. Yen-Chu Weng<span class="uw-slant-inline"></span><span class="quote-source-title">Program on the Environment</span></figcaption></div>

<p>Taiwan is a mountainous island and the orientation of the central mountain is from north to south. The main population centers are on the west coast. That&#8217;s where the plains are located and also the flatter areas of the terrain. When many people think about Taiwan, they always think about Taipei, which is the capital city. However, I really wanted to take students outside of Taipei to truly experience the diverse natural landscape of the country. My hope was to showcase the variety of environmental issues that Taiwanese societies face.</p>

<p>I structured the program to last for four weeks and for each week to focus on a different theme. The first week took place in Taipei, where we took a deep dive into eco-cities. Although Taipei is a highly populated metropolitan area, it is an urban area that is interwoven with mountains and rivers. Nature is constantly integrated into the design of urban landscapes. The second week also took place in Taipei but looked at food as culture given that food is a medium through which societies connect. I collaborated with <a href="https://www.geog.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/en/people/professors?id=905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Po-Yi Hung</a> from the Department of Geography at National Taiwan University. He showcased some of the mundane food we take for granted and traced the histories of how those foods represent identity. For example, he talked about the different claims regarding the origin of bubble tea and the various identities surrounding bubble teas that exist now when it comes to the selection of toppings. During those two weeks in Taipei, the 15 to 20 undergraduate UW students on my study abroad program closely collaborated with Taiwanese students from Professor Hung&#8217;s intensive summer courses. The students went on field trips together, such as picking tea leaves from an organic tea plantation and learning to cultivate tea leaves without pesticides or herbicides, and also spent time together outside of the formal study abroad program to explore the night markets of Taipei and to go on cross-cultural excursions together.</p>
<p>For the third week, we focused on renewable energy and community revitalization in Changhua County, which is a coastal community in central Taiwan. It is very rural and has traditionally been an agricultural community. In the past ten years or so, the region has attracted quite a lot of foreign investment, particularly investment in offshore wind power generation. This has created conflict in the area. Some of the older generation of Changhua County don&#8217;t want to have their traditional way of life interrupted by this new technology, but some of the younger generation see this new technology as an opportunity to transform their community and create new job opportunities. Some conservation groups are also worried that the construction of the wind turbines will endanger white dolphin species by disrupting their habitat. I wanted to show the students a very unique and local example that has cascading ripple effects across the globe, as many of the foreign investments are from European companies.</p>
<p>For the last week, we moved to Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to examine tourism and aboriginal communities. This area of Taiwan is much more tropical. We explored how land use conflicts can arise when nature areas exist within city limits. For example, how to balance the competing needs of local residents, some wanting to use the nature areas to hike, others wanting to protect their private property and others wanting to discourage tourists from engaging with the huge population of Taiwanese monkeys. While we were in southern Taiwan, we also learned about indigenous communities. We spent time in an aboriginal community to learn about some of the natural disasters they face and how they have learned to cope.</p>
<p>I ran this study abroad program in <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://sites.google.com/view/uw-poe-taiwan-2019/blogs__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!jf02GkeGzvTY4U9KHOH3OjXZdXok7lYBUnwLVlJ0LkmgfxrCj7PBGY66ft711KHoxqEy-ErN5hkJ$" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://sites.google.com/view/uw-poe-taiwan-2023/blogs__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!jf02GkeGzvTY4U9KHOH3OjXZdXok7lYBUnwLVlJ0LkmgfxrCj7PBGY66ft711KHoxqEy-HbHzMHR$" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023</a> and hope to run the program again in the future.</p>

<p>After launching my study abroad program to Taiwan, I began to explore other ways I could incorporate global learning into my day-to-day instruction in Seattle. I had a vision to create more inclusive global learning opportunities for students. I noticed there wasn&#8217;t a course at the UW that focused on environmental issues in East Asia, so I decided to create one to fill this gap &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400">“ENVIR 430/JSIS 484: Environmental Issues of East Asia”.</span> I am very thankful for my program director and for the <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/taiwan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taiwan Studies Program</a> at the <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies </a>for their support in launching and promoting the course. I was eager to offer UW students a different perspective. The course focuses on Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan. Every time I offer the course, it draws undergraduate students from both international studies and environmental studies, as well as a few graduate students looking to advance their degree in environmental policy in East Asia.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/taiwan/2021/01/19/winter-2021-lecture-series-contemporary-environmental-issues-in-taiwan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a>, I decided to apply for a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/gif/teachingcurriculum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching &amp; Curriculum Award</a> through the Office of Global Affairs&#8217; <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/gif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Innovation Fund</a> to bring even more of a global dimension to the course. I used the award funds to invite speakers from Taiwan and other scholars from East Asia to give virtual guest lectures. The lectures coincidentally mostly focused on climate change issues &#8211; from climate actions to public opinion about climate change to what data tells us about changes in climate patterns.</p>

I used the award funds to invite several speakers across East Asia to focus on different perspectives when it comes to renewable energy issues. All of the lectures were hosted as an online YouTube webinar so students, not just in my classes, but other students, can sign up to watch the virtual lectures. Thanks to the great support of the Taiwan Studies Program, all of those videos have been archived and are available to anyone who wants to watch them.</p>
<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>What inspired you to bring together students from the UW and Taiwan through Collaborative Online International Learning?</strong></footer>
<p>In 2022, I realized I wanted to learn more about how to reduce barriers to global learning for students. With that in mind, I applied to be a part of the first cohort of <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/uw-coil-fellows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Collaborative Online International Learning Fellows</a> (COIL) to include faculty from the Seattle campus. COIL, a virtual exchange pedagogy that creates multicultural learning environments by linking university classes in different countries, expanded to the Seattle campus in 2022 after several years of collaboration and success at the Bothell and Tacoma campuses.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/2023/02/22/2023-2024-uw-coil-fellows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023-2024 COIL Fellows</a> cohort, with the support of the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Global Affairs</a> at the Seattle campus, the <a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/oga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Global Affairs</a> at the Tacoma campus, and <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/connected-learning/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Initiatives</a> at the Bothell campus, was an amazing community of UW faculty interested in COIL pedagogy. We participated in workshops and trainings together during the Winter 2023 and Spring 2023 quarters and learned directly from previous COIL Fellows at the UW. Those two quarters that were focused on course development really helped me design my own COIL project.</p>
<p>I decided to branch out of my comfort zone and take an interdisciplinary approach by connecting with someone who is in the field of special education. I reached out to a professor at <a href="https://w3.nknu.edu.tw/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Kaohsiung Normal University</a> in Taiwan, Professor Chen-Chen Cheng, who was actually a colleague of mine from when I was a graduate student in Wisconsin. Our first challenge was to figure out how to develop and design a topic that would resonate with students from both of our courses and both of our universities. After a lot of brainstorming, we decided to focus our COIL project on evaluating the accessibility of interpretive signs in nature parks. The project included an environmental education piece, which my students could relate to, and an accessibility piece, which her student could relate to. <span style="font-weight: 400">We developed a protocol to analyze signs for their physical accessibility, communication accessibility, and multi-modality experience. </span></p>
<p>It took us about six months to plan the project, especially given the 15 hour time difference (my class met in the late afternoon and Professor Chen-Chen Cheng&#8217;s class met in the early morning) and because of scheduling, given the UW is on a quarter system and National Kaohsiung Normal University is on a semester system. We also created a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/uw-nknu-coil2024/home?pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Site</a> so all of the students could have access to the same information.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/2024/11/25/global-visionaries-yen-chu-weng/coil_1/'>COIL_1</a><br />

<a href='https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/2024/11/25/global-visionaries-yen-chu-weng/coil_3/'>COIL_3</a></p>
<p>What resulted was a five-week collaboration between my Environmental Issues of East Asia course and Professor Chen-Chen Cheng’s course in <a href="https://spe.nknu.edu.tw/Page_Single.aspx?Tid=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Education</a>. Students attended joint lectures for two hours each week &#8211; and collaborated offline outside of lectures &#8211; on the basic design principles for accessible interpretive signs and inclusive communication for people with disabilities. They also conducted field work to observe and analyze interpretive signs in their respective cities – The UW Arboretum and the UW Farm in Seattle and several parks in Kaohsiung and Tainan, two major cities in Southern Taiwan. The students were intentionally split into seven groups, with a mix of American and Taiwanese students in each group. On the last day of the COIL project, the groups co-facilitated short presentations on Zoom.</p>
<p>Throughout the COIL project, my students and I were really grateful for the Taiwanese students for navigating the project entirely in English. My students at the UW were aware of this privilege and tried to use Google Translate and to communicate using gestures and body language to navigate the language barriers. Overall, the students really enjoyed taking their learning outside the classroom and expanding their perspectives by learning about another culture and discovering new ways to look at issues around the world.</p>

<footer></footer>
<p>I was inspired to propose the idea for this course after noticing an increase in awareness about teaching about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) in social studies across the K to 12 curriculum. I wasn&#8217;t aware of much curriculum being developed around these goals at the higher education level and I was curious to see if there were other faculty members or researchers or staff at the UW who saw their work aligned with the goals. So in 2022, I applied to be a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/gif/fellows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Engagement Fellow</a> through the Global Innovation Fund to <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/2022-2023-global-engagement-fellows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a community</a> for faculty and staff at the UW to explore pedagogical tools to engage with the UN SDGs through their courses to promote global literacy and cross-cultural competence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-img wp-image-14510 size-sidebar-width alignright" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/01/30151536/SDG-logo-375x375.png" alt="" width="375" height="375" srcset="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/01/30151536/SDG-logo-375x375.png 375w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/01/30151536/SDG-logo-300x300.png 300w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/01/30151536/SDG-logo-150x150.png 150w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/01/30151536/SDG-logo.png 760w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>What I like about the UN SDGs is that there are 17 goals that foster peace and prosperity for people and the planet. While my own field relates more to the environmental elements of those goals, the goals encompass a wide range of critical issues, including poverty, social issues, gender equality, population health, education, infrastructure, global partnerships and policies and more. It&#8217;s a unique framework to think about how to address issues that every country in the world is facing and to discover solutions for how to improve the world.</p>
<p>During the Spring 2023 and Spring 2024 quarters, I was fortunate enough through a partnership with the Office of Global Affairs and the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/populationhealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Population Health Initiative</a> to offer a one credit General Studies course to introduce students to the UN SDGs called &#8220;<a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/achieving-the-un-sdgs-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Global Goals, Local Actions</a>&#8220;. The seminar invited experts and scholars from across the UW and the Seattle region to address each of the 17 goals. I reached out to UW faculty across campus to focus on different aspects of the UN SDGs to provide students with an interdisciplinary perspective.</p>
<figure id="quote-block" class="quote-block ">

<p>My goal was to cultivate a strong commitment to global citizenship among UW students. </blockquote><figcaption>Dr. Yen-Chu Weng<span class="uw-slant-inline"></span><span class="quote-source-title">Program on the Environment</span></figcaption></div>
</figure>
<p>After offering the course twice so far, I have been contacted by several faculty members at the UW who are also thinking about using the UN SDGs framework to develop a course in their own majors &#8211; such as in Food Systems, Nutrition, and Health and in Landscape Architecture. For future iterations, I plan to create more opportunities for the students in the course to build community and connect with the guest speakers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro"> This July, five undergraduate student leaders and a few staff members from the University of Washington boarded a plane to London, England. Their shared mission was to observe and research public and civil debates and to bring those lessons back to Seattle to design and implement civil discourse activities at the UW over the next three-to-five years.</p>

<p>This project, known as the Civil Discourse Project, is an innovative collaboration between the Brotherhood Initiative (BI) and the Sisterhood Initiative (SI) at the UW. It was conceived to provide a transformative learning experience for students of color and to contribute to larger efforts at the UW to foster civil dialogue. The purpose of the project is to develop a framework about civil discourse – one that includes emotional regulation, compassion, kindness, respectful disagreement and the prevention of physical and verbal attacks. That framework can then be adopted and/or adapted by research and practitioner communities for their own context.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Civil Discourse Project is an opportunity for students to identify nuance within their own communities and to challenge some of their generalizations around how civil discourse looks and how it should happen. It’s an opportunity to disrupt their thinking.&#8221; &#8211; Dr. Kandi Bauman, Assistant Director of Research and Curriculum, UW Brotherhood Initiative</p>

<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>Why did you decide to earn your bachelor&#8217;s degree in International Studies from UW Tacoma?</strong></footer>
<p>I studied International Studies because the intersection between history, politics, and sociology fascinates me. What I didn’t realize at the time, however, was how heavily the courses would impact my journey abroad. For example, studying sovereignty fed my curiosity to cross borders between countries on foot. I witnessed how contrasting worlds exist side by side, simply because the global community believes in imaginary lines drawn on the earth. Similarly, courses on indigenous history and international human rights inspired me to research indigeneity across continents. From the Coptic communities in Egypt, the Khmer people of Cambodia, to the aboriginal communities in Australia, I met descendants of history’s survivors who generously shared their family stories with me. My studies also taught the nuances of major world religions, and how followers of any given belief can’t be categorized monolithically. Whether a state proclaimed Hinduism, Buddhism, or an Abrahamic faith, I observed how individual approaches differed not only between countries, but also between regions within a country. In other words, my major taught me the facts and theories of such topics. During my travels abroad, I saw the real life application of everything I learned.</p>

<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>What was it like to serve as a UW Student Regent?</strong></footer>
<p>It was an honor to directly influence the university’s policy development, strategic planning, and financial oversight, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I became the first student to ever join meetings for UW Medicine’s Advisory Board, the Advisory Committee on Real Estate, and UW’s Investment Management Company. These bodies addressed important issues like distributing COVID-19 vaccines, developing capital projects, and maintaining the university’s endowment for student scholarships. I also regularly held townhalls with student governments across UW’s three campuses, where I shared updates, answered questions, and incorporated their perspectives in my work.</p>
<p>Thanks to the guidance of UW’s executive leaders, I developed a strong grasp on the institution’s governance structure. This enabled me to guide environmental advocates with a plan on encouraging UW to divest from fossil fuels. These efforts successfully drove the Board of Regents to approve divesting in fossil-fuel companies by 2027, while committing to investing at least 2.5% of the endowment into climate-solutions companies.</p>
<p>Another meaningful project was researching student experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. I partnered with UW’s Polling and Open Data Initiative, a student-run data analysis organization, to release a tri-campus survey and analyze over 3,700 student responses. I presented our findings to UW’s Board of Regents, focusing on student attitudes towards remote learning: what was challenging, what was helpful, and which newly-adopted practices should continue in a post-pandemic world. I also sent these recommendations to UW’s Center for Teaching &amp; Learning to incorporate into their pedagogical resources for faculty.</p>
<p>The opportunity to serve UW, our students and greater community was incredibly rewarding. By working alongside dedicated leaders, my term resulted in positive impacts for our community and leadership development that I carry to this day.</p>

<p>In Washington State, I was born into an immigrant family. I spoke Armenian at home, joined Holy Resurrection Armenian Apostolic Church, and grew involved in Seattle’s community. Many Armenians here —like my father— arrived as refugees from the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, escaping Azerbaijan’s massacres against them in the late 80s and early 90s. The history of Washington’s Armenians, however, is unique to us. Each community that formed around the world has its own origins of survival and perseverance.</p>
<p>After graduating from UW Tacoma, I decided to search for Armenian diasporas across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East by traveling through twenty-two countries. Armenians around the world showed me how their communities formed, how they preserve our culture outside the homeland, and how diverse our identity really is. I was able to find most communities by visiting each country’s Armenian Apostolic Church, which serves as a spiritual, cultural, and community center for Armenians around the world.</p>

<p>In Germany, I met Turkish-speaking Armenians whose families sought refuge after the 1915 Armenian Genocide. They invited me to Germany’s annual Christmas festival, Weihnachtsmarkt, eagerly showing me traditional cuisines, music, and crafts of German culture. Across the Levant, I met Arabic-speaking Armenians who also survived the 1915 Armenian Genocide. They invited me to eat Levantine food and dance dabke, both of which are influenced by Arab culture. In Kazakhstan, I met Armenians who arrived for economic opportunities during the Soviet Union. Together, we spoke Russian, ate Slavic food, and listened to music with Russian lyrics. While culturally influenced by their host country, each person was also strong and proud in their Armenian identity. They preserve our culture by practicing our nation’s 1700 year old liturgy, running Armenian dance and language schools, and organizing programs to stay united as a community.</p>
<p>Meeting Armenians around the globe taught me that, though we are a small population, we are incredibly diverse. As someone who always simply identified as Armenian, this experience also opened my eyes to how I was influenced by living in the United States. It also inspired me to search for the nuances within any culture around the world, no matter how big or small the population is.</p>
<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>What inspired you to travel through different countries by bicycle after graduation?</strong></footer>
<p>I wanted to experience life outside touristic sites, and I wanted to understand what truly exists between a country’s big cities. With just a bicycle to ride, a tent to sleep in, and gear stuffed into three bags, my solo journey immersed me in remote deserts, mountains, and villages of all sizes. From Morocco to Jordan to Kyrgyzstan, I pedaled hundreds of miles through places I knew nobody in and little about. This led me to deep connections with people around the globe, who opened my eyes to the nuances of each country’s culture and everyday life.</p>

<a href='https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/2024/10/28/global-visionaries-kristina-pogosian/blizzards-aftermath-outside-bakulyas-home/'>Blizzard</a></p>
<p>This is what happened, for example, when I got stuck in Kyrgyzstan’s mountains. Kyrgyzstan is a Turkic, Muslim, ex-Soviet country in Central Asia, where Russian is still taught as a second language. I communicated with everyone across this land because, due to Armenia’s own Soviet history, I also know Russian. While I cycled to an alpine lake, a middle-aged woman appeared alone on an empty field. This shocked me because, for dozens of miles, I saw nobody and nothing but snow-capped mountain ranges. Her name was Bakulya and, like most of the country’s population, she was native to Kyrgyzstan. We walked over to her family’s dwelling, surrounded by their herded sheep and horses. She invited me into their home, called a yurt. Traditional to the Kyrgyz nomadic lifestyle, it was made of bent wooden poles, covered by a canvas, all of which they easily disassembled when ready to move. Bakulya, her husband and his extended family welcomed me with soup and meat from their pastured lambs. After chatting for hours in Russian, they set up a cot with layers of quilts for me to sleep in. In the morning, we woke up freezing. The field of grass from the day before was now completely covered in snow. I wondered what would’ve happened to me had I not met Bakulya, had her family not welcomed me in, and had I slept in my tent outside.</p>
<p>I couldn’t cycle through the aftermath of that night’s blizzard, so Bakulya’s family kept me for an additional two days. In this time, she taught me how to milk their horses, sterilize and drink the milk, then cut horse hair and braid it into rope. Seated by the wood burner, Bakulya shared stories about her life. She described memories of living through the Soviet Union and experiencing its collapse in 1991. At 17 years old, like many girls in rural Kyrgyzstan, Bakulya was kidnapped and forced into marriage. She expressed happiness, however, for the life she built with her husband. This included raising children who, as adults, left nomadism for Kyrgyzstan’s bustling city life. By cycling through countries, I traded discomfort and uncertainty for serendipity like this. The generous kindness of people, like Bakulya, immersed me into life in the most unexpected ways. These are important parts of a country that I was able to see by traveling on bicycle.</p>
<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>How do you spread awareness about Armenian history and culture?</strong></footer>
<p>I spread awareness through public speaking, political advocacy, and community organizing. In different countries, I reached out to universities and organizations that hosted me as a guest speaker. It was incredibly rewarding to connect with local audiences around our world, from Morocco to Kazakhstan to Australia. My presentations highlighted the Armenian communities I visited across continents, explaining how each one formed and how they preserve our culture. I also shared family stories, like my grandparents’ imprisonment in Soviet forced labor camps, my father’s escape from massacres in Azerbaijan, and my own experience as an Armenian woman raised in the United States. During the presentations, I facilitated group discussions and asked questions like, “How do you define your identity?”, “Which cultural differences exist between you and your grandparents?”, and “What is something about your life today that would make your ancestors proud?” While sharing my own heritage, these discussions also helped me understand the history, culture, and everyday life of the people hosting me.</p>

<p>Back in Washington, I co-chair our state’s chapter for the Armenian Assembly of America. We meet with elected officials to advocate for aiding Artsakh refugees, releasing prisoners of war in Azerbaijan, and increasing education for the 1915 Armenian Genocide. We also help organize the annual Armenian Festival of Seattle, showcasing our culture to over 1,000 visitors across the Pacific Northwest. Previously, I helped found and chair Washington’s Armenian Church Youth Organization, which established Seattle’s only network of Armenian young adults through social and cultural programming. Since then, I joined the choir at Holy Resurrection Armenian Apostolic Church in Redmond. This is the only Armenian Apostolic Church in Washington State, where we observe our nation’s 1700-year-old Liturgy.</p>

<p>From legislative advocacy, community organizing, to cultural preservation, these achievements are only possible through our community’s strong teamwork. I am very fortunate to be a part of this effort to keep our culture alive, in and outside of our homeland.</p>
<footer class="mt-2 font-weight-bold" style="color: #85754d;font-size: 1em"><strong>As a recent UW graduate, what are you looking forward to about your career?</strong></footer>
<p>I am excited to continue my education and career goals, all while serving our community. Along with the leadership experience I gained through the University of Washington, my perspective was shaped immensely by experiencing life in 22 countries. Traveling by bicycle helped me become courageous and comfortable with uncertainty. Immersing myself in different cultures helped me become adaptable, understanding of norms different from mine, and aware of what diversity looks like outside the American context. It also gave me an opportunity to form deep connections with people, regardless of language barriers or cultural differences. Connecting with Armenian diasporas helped me better understand myself, as well as the nuance that exists among immigrant communities in the United States. These experiences equip me to conquer new challenges. They also inspire me to advocate for cultural competence that’s not just a mere toleration, but a sincere embrace. My goal is to continue applying these lessons in my journey, as I go to law school in the future. Until then, I am staying involved in Seattle’s Armenian community, offering speaking engagements, and writing a book about my journey abroad.</p>

<p>My background includes extensive work in strengthening health systems with a focus on Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) and digital health. For several years, I worked in Tanzania, supporting efforts to improve the quality of HIV/AIDS services across numerous regions and health facilities. Due to the challenges of providing on-site technical assistance to all facilities, my team and I developed the Digital CQI Platform—a web-based tool designed to streamline the monitoring and reporting of CQI initiatives. This platform reduced reliance on paper-based systems and enabled remote support for facilities that were difficult to reach promptly. The success of the platform in Tanzania led to its expansion into other countries, including Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda, and Botswana.</p>
<h2>Why were you in Jamaica this summer?</h2>
<p>My involvement in Jamaica began under the guidance of my supervisor, Nancy Puttkammer, a co-faculty lead at the <a href="https://www.go2itech.org/digital-initiatives-group-at-i-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Initiatives Group at I-TECH</a> (DIGI) and a Professor at the Department of Global Health, as part of our efforts to adapt the Digital CQI Platform, better known as the CQI App, for use in the Caribbean. Working closely with other DIGI colleagues, we successfully rolled out the CQI App in Jamaica earlier this year. I traveled to Jamaica this summer as part of my DrGH program to conduct an evaluation, where I am honing my skills in evaluating digital health initiatives. The evaluation aimed to gather insights into user experiences and identify challenges to refine our adaptation and scale-up strategies for the CQI App.</p>
<p>The trip was meticulously planned and fully supported by <a href="https://www.go2itech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I-TECH</a>, <a href="https://ctech-caribbean.org/overview-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C-TECH</a>, DIGI, <a href="https://globalhealth.washington.edu/academic-programs/doctor-global-health-leadership-and-practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DrGH</a> program leadership, and the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Office of Global Affairs</a>, all of whom worked closely with me to ensure I adhered to all safety precautions. Despite these thorough preparations, nothing could have prepared me for the experience of facing Hurricane Beryl—a challenge like none I had anticipated!</p>
<h2>Describe your experience driving across the island before Hurricane Beryl landed.</h2>
<figure id="attachment_16121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16121" style="width: 300px" class="figure figure-caption wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-img wp-image-16121 size-medium" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141507/Driving-to-Montego-Bay-300x171.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141507/Driving-to-Montego-Bay-300x171.jpg 300w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141507/Driving-to-Montego-Bay-1024x584.jpg 1024w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141507/Driving-to-Montego-Bay-375x214.jpg 375w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141507/Driving-to-Montego-Bay-1200x685.jpg 1200w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141507/Driving-to-Montego-Bay.jpg 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16121" class="wp-caption-text">Driving to Montego Bay </figcaption></figure>
<p>I arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, on June 29, with plans to begin our evaluation work on June 30. Despite having no personal experience with hurricanes, I was initially unfazed when I first heard of Hurricane Beryl’s approach. However, the severity of the situation soon became clear. As Georgia Simmonds, the CQI lead in Jamaica, and I drove from Kingston to Montego Bay on July 1, two days before the predicted landfall, the drive felt strikingly surreal. The weather was deceptively calm, with clear blue skies—a stark contrast to the Category 5 hurricane looming ahead. Georgia shared stories of past hurricanes in Jamaica, particularly one in the 1970s that caused widespread devastation, which underscored the potential threat we were facing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_16127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16127" style="width: 300px" class="figure figure-caption wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-img wp-image-16127 size-medium" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141548/Quite-and-peaceful-just-a-day-before-the-hurricane-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141548/Quite-and-peaceful-just-a-day-before-the-hurricane-300x169.jpg 300w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141548/Quite-and-peaceful-just-a-day-before-the-hurricane-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141548/Quite-and-peaceful-just-a-day-before-the-hurricane-375x211.jpg 375w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141548/Quite-and-peaceful-just-a-day-before-the-hurricane-1200x676.jpg 1200w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/09/09141548/Quite-and-peaceful-just-a-day-before-the-hurricane.jpg 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16127" class="wp-caption-text">The day before landfall </figcaption></figure>
<p>As we neared Montego Bay and settled into the Riu Hotel, the island&#8217;s preparations for the hurricane were evident. Military convoys, supply trucks, and locals scrambling for essentials highlighted the seriousness of the impending storm. Despite this, the serene drive seemed at odds with the palpable tension around us. That evening, our team wisely decided to return to Kingston immediately after our meeting the next day, ahead of the hurricane’s expected landfall. This decision was crucial, as a 24-hour curfew was enforced across the island early Wednesday morning, making further travel impossible.</p>
<p>The drive back to Kingston on July 2 was marked by an eerie quiet and heavy traffic, with residents rushing to secure their homes and gather supplies. Georgia’s insights into hurricane preparedness provided a clearer picture of what was to come. For someone like me, who had never experienced a hurricane, the journey was an eye-opening lesson in the gravity of natural disasters and the resilience required to face them.</p>
<h2>What did you do once Hurricane Beryl hit the island?</h2>

<p>I initially stayed at the Courtleigh Hotel in Kingston before moving to the Riu Hotel in Montego Bay. However, as Hurricane Beryl approached, we returned to Kingston to be closer to established safety networks. On July 3, the day the hurricane was expected to make landfall, the island was under a strict curfew. The morning began with deceptively calm and clear skies, but as the outer bands of the hurricane reached the island, the situation quickly deteriorated with fierce winds and torrential rains.</p>
<p>I watched in disbelief from my hotel room as the powerful winds roared through the city, uprooting trees and causing significant damage, including downed streetlights and palm trees in nearby Emancipation Park. The winds were so intense that the hotel staff swiftly moved all guests to a secure, windowless room for protection. This precaution lasted about an hour before the intensity gradually subsided as the hurricane moved further from the island. Although its worst impact bypassed my immediate location, the broader destruction across the island was still severe, with widespread loss of power, water, and communication services. The experience was unique and sobering, making me reflect on the potential catastrophe that could have unfolded had the hurricane made a direct hit.</p>
<h2>Were you able to complete your focus groups and key informant interviews after returning to Seattle?</h2>

</figure>
<p>		Thanks to the dedication and resilience of the C-TECH team, we were able to resume some evaluation activities the following week once essential services were restored. However, with certain areas of the island still inaccessible and recovery efforts taking priority, we had to push some sessions weeks ahead. I joined virtually since I had to return to Seattle. This experience highlighted the importance of adaptability and flexibility when conducting fieldwork, as unexpected events are a constant reality in global health. Challenges such as natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other unforeseen obstacles can arise unpredictably, requiring swift adjustments and contingency planning.</footer>

<h2>How did the UW Global Travel Health and Safety team support you?</h2>
<p>The UW Global Travel Health and Safety team was a constant source of reassurance and guidance throughout my stay in Jamaica, particularly as Hurricane Beryl approached. From the onset, they provided critical updates and safety recommendations, ensuring my location and well-being were closely monitored through the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/global-travelers/global-insurance/international-sos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International SOS</a> App. Their proactive support and continuous check-ins were invaluable during this challenging time. Even amidst rapidly changing conditions, their dedication to my safety exemplified the highest standards of care and professionalism, and I am deeply grateful for their unwavering support.</p>

<p>Nicola Kalderash is a cybersecurity professional at Boeing. He earned a Master of Science in Information Management and a Bachelor of Science in Informatics with a concentration in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance and a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies with a concentration in China and Foreign Policy, Diplomacy, National Security &amp; Peace from the University of Washington. Prior to the University of Washington, he earned his Associate of Arts in General Studies at Seattle Central College.</p>
<p>In 2016, during his studies at Seattle Central College, he was awarded the <a href="https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship</a> to study abroad in Shanghai, China. In 2019, during his studies at the University of Washington, he was awarded the Robert N. Chang Foundation scholarship to study abroad in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Studying in Taiwan</strong></h3>
<p>Nicola chose to study at the <a href="https://iclp.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Chinese Language Program at National Taiwan University</a> to complete the language requirement for his Bachelor of Arts in International Studies. He opted to go to Taipei for the entire summer to take part in an intensive language program to advance his Mandarin language skills. After studying in China, Nicola was curious to learn more about the culture and history of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Studying at National Taiwan University was an intense, competitive learning environment. After taking a difficult placement exam that assessed his oral and written Mandarin skills, he signed a language pledge that he wasn’t going to speak English while in class. Throughout the program, Nicola studied Mandarin one-on-one with his teacher in the mornings and then practiced Mandarin with a small language class of just four students in the afternoons. None of the other students in his cohort were from the University of Washington.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_15940" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15940" style="width: 300px" class="figure figure-caption wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-img wp-image-15940 size-medium" style="color: #3d3d3d" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06145613/Screenshot_20240730-080449-300x296.png" alt="Waterfall in between green mountains with grey clouds above" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06145613/Screenshot_20240730-080449-300x296.png 300w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06145613/Screenshot_20240730-080449-375x370.png 375w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06145613/Screenshot_20240730-080449.png 1007w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15940" class="wp-caption-text">Taroko Gorge </figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of the classroom, Nicola took advantage of an internship opportunity with a cloud startup company. He helped the company to create a comprehensive security manual, ranging from what to do in the event of an emergency to establishing standard practices for formatting code. Nicola also had the spontaneous opportunity to be featured in an interview about cross-cultural romance that was shared widely across China and Taiwan.</p>
<p>On the weekends, Nicola explored Taipei and took trips to discover new areas across Taiwan, from beaches to temples to waterfalls. He enjoyed taking the train, exploring the sights and sounds and learning about the culture and history of Taiwan.</p>
<figure id="quote-block" class="quote-block ">
<div class="mb-0 text-center">
<blockquote>
<p>By the end of the program, I always tell people that it was evident how much I had learned. I not only gave my final presentation entirely in Mandarin, but on the way to the airport I had a full conversation with the taxi driver in Mandarin. It was clear to me just how much I had grown and learned since I stepped foot off the plane in Taipei a few months before.</blockquote><figcaption>Nicola Kalderash<span class="uw-slant-inline"></span><span class="quote-source-title">UW alumnus</span></figcaption></div>
</figure>
<figure id="attachment_15948" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15948" style="width: 300px" class="figure figure-caption wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-img wp-image-15948 size-medium" src="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06150141/Nicola-Taiwan-2-300x267.jpg" alt="Man sitting on a rock overlooking a city with skyscrapers and tall buildings in the distance" width="300" height="267" srcset="https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06150141/Nicola-Taiwan-2-300x267.jpg 300w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06150141/Nicola-Taiwan-2-375x334.jpg 375w, https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/08/06150141/Nicola-Taiwan-2.jpg 1007w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15948" class="wp-caption-text">A hike overlooking Taipei </figcaption></figure>
<p>When Nicola realized he wanted to study abroad in Taiwan, he knew it was going to be expensive. So he researched all of the scholarships that he could find. After seeking guidance from the <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies</a>, Nicola applied for a <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/advise/funding/flas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship Program</a> and for a Robert N. Chang Foundation scholarship. With the support of those two funding sources, as well as financial aid, it ended up being feasible for him to study abroad in Taiwan for the summer.</p>
<p>Studying in Taiwan helped Nicola step outside of his comfort zone. It made him more aware of the privileges of American citizens. He also walked away with a greater appreciation of different cultures.</p>
<figure id="quote-block" class="quote-block ">
<div class="mb-0 text-center">
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly believe that it’s worth the time and effort to apply for scholarship opportunities because it can open up doors to see the world and learn about other cultures. Traveling the world and seeing other countries gives you a better sense of who you are.</blockquote><figcaption>Nicola Kalderash<span class="uw-slant-inline"></span><span class="quote-source-title">UW alumnus</span></figcaption></div>
</figure>
<h3><strong>Giving Back</strong></h3>
<p>Now that Nicola is a working professional, he is finding opportunities to give back. During his graduate studies at the UW, he was the chapter president of the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), an international nonprofit organization that advocates for professionals in the information security, assurance, risk management and governance industries. After receiving a scholarship from ISACA for foundational cybersecurity skills as a graduate student, Nicola is now taking the lead to create a new scholarship opportunity from ISACA. The scholarship is available to juniors, seniors and graduate students who attend a university in the Puget Sound area. The winner and runner-up of the innovative scholarship will receive cash awards to pay for a certification of their choosing as well as their student membership fee.</p>
<figure id="quote-block" class="quote-block ">
<div class="mb-0 text-center">
<blockquote>
<p>I was really blessed and thankful for all of the scholarships I received during my undergraduate and graduate studies. It’s really important for me to give back. It’s all about a virtuous circle.</blockquote><figcaption>Nicola Kalderash<span class="uw-slant-inline"></span><span class="quote-source-title">UW alumnus</span></figcaption></div>
</figure>
<h3><strong>The Robert N. Chang Foundation</strong></h3>
<p>The Robert N. Chang Foundation was named after Robert N. Chang, a University of Washington alumnus who bequeathed his wealth in the form of his family foundation. The foundation is currently managed by his nephew, Allan Liu, and wife Mei-Lee Liu. Historically, Robert N. Chang Foundation scholarships have been granted to incoming or outgoing students from Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.</p>

<h5>What inspired you to participate?</h5>
<p>Much of my teaching and research involves environmental sustainability. In particular, I developed new content on the SDGs in my Sustainable Engineering and Design course this past quarter. With Finland being one of the pioneers in the SDG community, I did not hesitate in wanting to learn from Finnish administrators, faculty and researchers and to potentially collaborate with them to develop mutually beneficial opportunities for our institutions.</p>
<h5>Did you learn about any new or innovative best practices for integrating the SDGs into university strategies and teaching?</h5>
<p>Aalto University&#8217;s work in integrating the SDGs into their curriculum and course development is something I&#8217;d like to help replicate at UWT and UW overall. With the overall goal of supporting students&#8217; ability to contribute to a more sustainable world, I believe the focus on understanding linkages and interactions of the SDG targets is highly beneficial. Students at UW would find the implementation of sustainability labels in course descriptions useful. The various opportunities through the Fulbright program can foster numerous collaborations for students and faculty alike. I personally would love to pursue a fellowship in the future.</p>
<h5>What are you key takeaways from the experience?</h5>
<p>I was particularly impressed with LUT University&#8217;s passion and enthusiasm for prioritizing the SDGs in various programs, including those that traditionally don&#8217;t consider it much in the U.S. I felt there was much for our U.S. institutions to learn that it is very much possible and important.</p>
<h5>How do you plan to collaborate with your Finnish counterparts moving forward?</h5>
<p>I plan on engaging with the UW participants as well as my colleagues at UWT to discuss developing exchange programs for graduate and research students and study abroad programs for our undergraduates.</p>

<h5>What inspired you to participate?</h5>
<p>I was interested in participating to learn more about SDG implementation to improve as a researcher and to contribute effectively to urban health research in line with global objectives. I thought that it would provide an ideal opportunity for networking and developing potential collaborations, which would be valuable at my stage of training as a doctoral student. I also thought that this training would align well with my overall career objectives, as I intend to continue working alongside transdisciplinary and multi-country teams that are similarly committed to addressing complex urban health challenges.</p>
<h5>Did you learn about any new or innovative best practices for integrating the SDGs into university strategies and teaching?</h5>
<p>Yes, we were introduced to SDG activities that encouraged us to think about the interdependence of the SDGs. Specifically, these exercises helped us think through potential conflicting impacts of achieving the SDGs in our own efforts. I thought this was a valuable exercise to critically engage with the SDGs, allowing us to better understand how to minimize unintended consequences, and where it was not possible, where there is opportunity for innovation. I found this approach to thinking holistically about SDG implementation to be informative and practical.</p>
<h5>What are you key takeaways from the experience?</h5>
<p>My key takeaway was the impressive commitment of Finnish universities to integrating the SDGs as a framework guiding their institutional efforts. This includes teaching, research, campus design and infrastructure, and even investment decisions. Learning about their comprehensive approach was inspiring and demonstrated what is possible with shared commitment and collaboration towards a common goal. This experience has broadened my perspective on the role academic institutions can play in catalyzing positive change, particularly with respect to sustainable development.</p>
<h5>How do you plan to collaborate with your Finnish counterparts moving forward?</h5>
<p>I plan to collaborate with my Finnish counterparts primarily through research initiatives. Learning about financial mechanisms, such as the Research Council of Finland-National Institutes of Health Partnership Program, was particularly exciting. These mechanisms can significantly amplify the scope of our research projects. I am eager to explore these opportunities and work together on projects that address urban health challenges, leveraging the strengths, expertise, and existing partnerships of both teams.</p>

<h5>What inspired you to participate?</h5>
<p>A major part of my role is partnership and program management. The responsibilities under this category are provision of oversight and coordination of the WA MESA STEM curriculum for grade-level MESA Programs. In addition, I am required to lead continuous improvement efforts to refine systems and processes, and address gaps in partnership support services. I meet regularly with our directors to share information, solicit input and address needs.</p>
<p>This past year I have been pulling together a resource base and curriculum to help them support their teachers and students as they prepare to engage on a national platform. My goals for the year include engagement with our 18 directors (including site visits to the MESA centers) in my endeavor to develop a program repository. In one portion of my work, the comprehensive build-up to showcase the Washington MESA standards and goals operates through the signature National Engineering Design Competition (NEDC) is held every June. All MESA states participate in this event. The current theme is “Designing for Equity Locally to Affect Sustainability Globally”. This buildup is not limited to the event but engages students comprehensively through the year using our logic model as they engage in academic enrichment, high-impact STEM practice, mentoring, STEM career exposure etc. through in-class instruction and after school programs.</p>
<p>Per the mission, the NEDC asks students to identify an individual or group who experiences an inequity (i.e., a user). Then, using a coding element as the main component of their design, employ human-centered design practices to engineer a solution. Students must also align their projects to the SDGs in an effort that leads to meeting the mandated theme. The SDGs are embedded in the requirements every year. Teams must use the SDGs in a community-centered capacity for their project. In my role, I am required to plan and oversee our WA MESA state competition and support the students that proceed to the national event.</p>
<p>My intention for attending the Staff Training Week in Finland was to expand on our curriculum reach. I planned to return with tools that we could add to our resource database. WA MESA Crosscutting Activity also requires the development of a WA MESA Resource Library – a collection of resources to help centers implement programs and services that will be available on the digital platform. Our MESA College Prep Logic Model (Program Toolkit) requires, “high-quality STEM integration problems that promote inquiry and problem solving, incorporate technology and provide students with multi-cultural and multi-perspective viewpoints”. My goal was also to add this global perspective that will ultimately help our MESA students extend their exposure to global solutions in their curriculum offerings.</p>
<h5>Did you learn about any new or innovative best practices for integrating the SDGs into university strategies and teaching?</h5>
<p>I learned a lot about best practices for integrating the SDGs into university and also pre-university strategies and teaching. The Finnish Universities “live and breathe” SDG goal-implementation and this is evident in the design and operation of facilities and in their educational structure. The SDG focus is woven into their programs and courses in an intentional and structured manner. One example is the tagging of courses that address specific SDGs and make it easy for students to select SDG-themed courses in the registration system. Professors infuse the SDGs into their courses in a way that flows and shows their application seamlessly.</p>
<p>I also loved hearing about the collaborations between other universities (some of them in Africa). They relate to the researchers outside as equal partners even as they lead the world in SDG implementation. The project examples were very practical and community-oriented. It was interesting to see how the Junior University functions at LUT – Lappeenranta. Since one section of our MESA program provides pathways for students from the K-12 system into the post- secondary domain, it was good to be able to see how they do outreach and share the framework of our MESA program. The Jamie Hyneman Prototype lab was also very inspiring among several other initiatives across the campuses. The invitation for students to be creative in this environment and this build skills outside the classroom is similar to our UW MILL (McCarty Innovation Learning Lab). It was great to see the prototype lab there initiated by a world &#8211; famous scientist.</p>
<h5>What are you key takeaways from the experience?</h5>
<p>In a nutshell, Finland has a lot to showcase as an example. Collaboration with the U.S. and other regions is a great way to share and have an ongoing exchange of information in educational practices.</p>
<h5>How do you plan to collaborate with your Finnish counterparts moving forward?</h5>
<p>I plan to collaborate with other UW campuses on a study abroad program to Finland (marketing to all students but with a focus on under-represented students in STEM). I also intend to co-teach on sustainability courses and incorporate SDG examples into local projects (Washington MESA curriculum). Lastly, I aim to continue sharing ideas with my Finnish colleagues during possible visits by them to U.S. universities to continue the relationships and networking that have already begun.</p>

<p>Kamai designed the course to be accessible to all UW students. No astronomy or physics background was required. For Kamai, it was an opportunity to share the wisdom of her ancestors and about modern day concepts of astrophysics to deepen students&#8217; understanding about the cosmos. <span style="font-weight: 400">Students learned about the roles of voyagers within the Hawaiian Renaissance and how critical it has been to bring back </span>deep-sea sailing canoes and Indigenous practices of navigating in traditional ways without external instruments.</p>
