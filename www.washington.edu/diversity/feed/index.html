										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>On November 8, we will join the <a id="" class="mktNoTrack" href="https://firstgen.naspa.org/engagement/first-generation-college-celebration/first-generation-college-celebration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Council for Opportunity in Education, NASPA’s Center for First-Generation Student Success</a>, and higher education institutions across the country in celebrating National First-Generation College Celebration Day. This day marks the anniversary of the signing of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a pivotal moment that expanded access to higher education for many, including first-generation college students.</p>
<p>As a first-generation college graduate, I know firsthand the challenges and rewards of this journey. The path may be filled with uncertainties, but it is also paved with opportunities for growth and success. Through your strong character and academic excellence, you will thrive. However, I encourage you to ask for help when needed. Asking for help is a sign of strength and wisdom, not a weakness.</p>
<p>At the University of Washington, we are committed to supporting our first-generation students, faculty and staff from UW Bothell, to Seattle, to UW Tacoma. Your presence enriches the whole of our campus community and brings diverse perspectives that are invaluable to the collective Husky Experience. We recognize the strength and determination it takes to be a trailblazer, and we are here to support you every step of the way.</p>
<p>This year, we have planned <a id="" class="mktNoTrack" href="https://www.washington.edu/diversity/national-first-gen-day/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of events and activities</a> to celebrate the first-gen Husky Experience These events are designed to connect you with fellow first-generation students, faculty and staff and to provide opportunities for personal and professional development. We encourage you to participate and to take advantage of the support available to you.</p>
<p>To all our first-generation students, faculty and staff, know that you belong here and that your contributions are deeply valued. <a id="" class="mktNoTrack" href="https://www.washington.edu/provost/2023/10/31/sharing-my-journey-from-first-gen-college-student-to-provost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Provost Tricia Serio</a>, <a id="" class="mktNoTrack" href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/chancellor/reflections-first-generation-student" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Tacoma Chancellor Sheila Edwards Lange</a>, countless other faculty, staff and notable UW alumni share the first-gen experience with you. You can find encouragement in their stories and the stories of others that are shared on the <a id="" class="mktNoTrack" href="https://www.washington.edu/diversity/national-first-gen-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW First-Generation College Celebration website</a>.</p>
<p>Together, we will continue to foster an environment where every first-generation student can achieve their full academic potential.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our community and for celebrating this important day with us. Let’s continue to support each other and to celebrate the diverse experiences that make our university excellent.</p>
<p>In Community,</p>
