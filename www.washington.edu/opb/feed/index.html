										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) released its November <a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/meetings/rev20241120_0.pdf">revenue forecast</a> on Wednesday, November 20, 2024. Revenue projections were down slightly for the current 2023-25 biennium as well as for the upcoming 2025-27 biennium.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2024/10/07/september-revenue-forecast-flat-for-current-and-2025-27-biennia/">September</a>, we highlighted that experts expected revenue to remain steady relative to previous projections for the current and upcoming biennia. Declines in expected revenue from the State’s sales tax were largely offset by positive revenue growth from the estate tax and real estate excise tax (REET).</p>
<p>The November 2024 forecast notes that inflation is slowing but that Seattle-area consumer price inflation (CPI) continues to exceed the national average, with the seasonally adjusted CPI rising 3.0% compared to the 2.6% increase in the U.S. City Average index. With inflation slowing, the Federal Reserve recently reduced interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Another rate cut is expected during the Federal Reserve’s December meeting, with the potential for additional rate cuts next year. However, current high interest rates, the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the potential for tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump administration all pose risks to the economy.</p>
<p>Given these factors, the forecast projects that <strong>state revenue will decrease by $89 million for the current 2023-25 biennium and decrease by $181 million for the 2025-27 biennium compared to the September forecast.</strong></p>
<p>These revisions are due to declines in expected revenue from the State’s sales and business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax as well as from the State’s lottery. These declines are partially offset by positive revenue growth in other areas.</p>
<p>the revenue revisions for November are relatively modest, the projections further strain Washington’s $72 billion biennial budget. <strong>Currently, </strong>the Governor’s <strong>Office of Financial Management is projecting between a </strong><strong>$10 and $12 billion budget deficit over the next four years</strong>. This projected deficit is the result of several factors including increasing demand for state services, rising costs and inflation, and decreasing revenue, as well as newly negotiated collective bargaining agreements for state workers. The Legislature could rely on a mix of budget cuts and revenue increases to balance the budget when it meets early next year. As such, OFM recently asked state agencies to prepare initial plans for budget reductions.</p>
<p><strong>More background on the state revenue forecasts can be accessed </strong><a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2019/10/23/what-is-the-revenue-forecast/">on our website</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Near General Fund-State</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the total preliminary and projected Near General Fund-State (GF-S) revenue for each biennium.</p>
<ul>
<li>$66.39 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, 0.1% below the previous forecast. However, total revenue for this biennium is still forecasted to grow over the previous 2021-23 biennium.</li>
<li>$71.43 billion for the 2025-27 biennium, 0.3% above the previous forecast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context behind the numbers for Near GF-S accounts from which the University receives funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasted revenue dedicated to the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA) has decreased by $4.0 million for the 2023-25 biennia and by $7.6 million for the 2025-27 biennia. <strong>Forecasted WEIA revenue is now $881.8 million for the 2023-25 biennium and $944.7 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
<li>The forecast for Education Legacy Trust Account (ELTA) revenue has increased by $48.5 million in the 2023-25 biennium but decreased by $54.2 million in the 2025-27 biennium. <strong>Forecasted ELTA revenue is now $2.09 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, and $2.3 billion for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The November revenue forecast will inform Governor Inslee’s 2025-27 biennial budget proposals, which will be released in December. This is Governor Inslee’s final proposal, as Governor-elect Bob Ferguson will be taking office in January. Stay tuned for updates on those requests, as well as the upcoming legislative session, which begins January 13, 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) released its February <a href="/erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/meetings/rev20240214.pdf">revenue forecast</a> on Wednesday, February 14, 2024. Revenue projections were again revised upward for the current 2023-25 biennium as well as for the 2025-27 biennium.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2023/11/21/november-revenue-forecast-revised-upward-for-current-biennium/">November</a>, we highlighted that experts expected revenue to increase over recent projections for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia. This growth was driven by the continued strength of the job market.</p>
<p>The February 2024 forecast notes that the Seattle-area consumer price inflation continued to exceed the national average, with the seasonally adjusted CPI rising 4.4% compared to the 3.4% increase in the U.S. City Average index. However, inflation continues to slow, and it is expected that the Federal Reserve will start reducing interest rates in the second quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, slowing consumer demand driven by high interest rates and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to pose risks to the economy.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the forecast projects that <strong>state revenue growth is expected to increase by $122 million in the 2023-25 biennium and increase by $215 million for the 2025-27 biennium compared to the November forecast. </strong></p>
<p>As noted, these numbers represent an improvement over the previous forecast. While revenue growth remains slow, the projected increases are driven by the continued strength of the job market, both nationally and at the state level. Washington’s unemployment rate for December was at 4.2%, a slight increase from previous months.</p>
<p><strong>More background on the state revenue forecasts can be accessed </strong><a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2019/10/23/what-is-the-revenue-forecast/">on our website</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Near General Fund-State</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the total preliminary and projected Near General Fund-State (GF-S) revenue for each biennium.</p>
<ul>
<li>$67 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, 0.2% over the expected 2023-25 biennium.</li>
<li>$71.72 billion for the 2025-27 biennium, 0.3% over the expected 2025-27 biennium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context behind the numbers for Near GF-S accounts from which the University receives funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasted revenue dedicated to the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA) has increased by $13 million for the 2023-25 biennia and increased by $31 million for the 2025-27 biennia. <strong>Forecasted WEIA revenue is now $856 million for the 2023-25 biennium and $910 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
<li>The forecast of Education Legacy Trust Account (ELTA) revenue was increased by $31.5 million in the 2023-25 biennium and increased by $6 million in the 2025-27 biennium. <strong>Forecasted ELTA revenue is now $2.17 billion for the 2023-25 biennium and $2.38 billion for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Washington State House of Representatives and Senate will release their proposed 2024 supplemental budgets later this month. A final compromise supplemental budget is expected to be adopted in early March before the end of the legislative session. Stay tuned to the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/opb-blog/">OPBlog</a> for updates on these proposals.</p>

<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Message from Sarah Hall:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I am truly honored to have been asked by President Cauce and Provost Serio to lead our new Finance, Planning and Budgeting team. I am excited for us to pool our expertise, efforts and creativity as a new organization and build on our work in service to a great public university that is deeply committed to its student access, excellent teaching, public service, discovery, and health missions. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I want to extend my gratitude and congratulations to Brian McCartan, who has not only been a thoughtful and strategic partner in our shared work, but also supportive and gracious as we prepare for this transition. I wish Brian all the best in his retirement. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Together we now have the opportunity, and the mandate, to urgently address the challenges we continue to encounter with Workday Finance, and to provide a level of strategy, analysis and decision support to our President, Provost, and Board that we were previously unable to provide. The imperative to stabilize our implementation of this software is both an opportunity and a responsibility that we all take seriously. I know we have a lot of work to do and I’m confident we can make further progress together. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By uniting our teams, we can create more efficient and mutually supportive relationships and leverage expertise which may have been duplicative or not fully utilized in the past.  This will allow us to focus on our shared work and provide excellent analysis, reporting, planning, controls, and support to the broader UW. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moving ahead, I look forward to aligning our shared goals, growing together, supporting each other through this initial transition, and creating an organizational alignment that serves the University and our community. There’s a lot at stake, and we will need everyone’s help.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Between now and June 2024, we will undergo an assessment and consultation to further integrate our teams. We will do this in an organized way, taking into account how we might pool our resources and expertise to align further in support of each other, and our work on behalf of the UW. We will use a mix of qualitative and quantitative measures to land an integration plan by June 2024. I will work closely with those in leadership positions to co-create an integration plan that sets us up for success long-term.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I look forward to listening, learning, and collaborating to evolve our Finance, Planning and Budgeting Team with a shared vision to serve and support the instructional, research, service, and patient health missions of the University.

<p>President Ana Mari Cauce and Provost Tricia Serio announced an organizational and leadership restructuring in the areas of finance, planning and budgeting aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these areas’ service to the University community.

Previously, finance and business services fell under Vice President Brian McCartan, who is retiring.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) released its November <a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/meetings/rev112023.pdf">revenue forecast</a> on Monday, November 20, 2023. Revenue projections were again revised upward for the current 2023-25 biennium as well as for the 2025-27 biennium.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2023/10/04/september-revenue-forecast-revised-upward-for-current-biennium-returning-to-previously-projected-levels-despite-slowing-growth/">September</a>, we highlighted that experts expected revenue to increase over recent projections for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia, returning to levels that had been anticipated in the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2022/11/22/november-revenue-forecast-reports-increased-projections-for-the-current-and-upcoming-biennia-while-economic-growth-continues-to-slow/">November</a> 2022 forecast. This growth was driven by the continued strength of the job market.</p>
<p>The November 2023 forecast notes that the Seattle-area consumer price inflation continued to exceed the national average, with the seasonally adjusted CPI rising 4.8% compared to the 3.2% increase in the U.S. City Average index. Given the continued relatively high rate of inflation, the forecast assumes the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to a range of 5.5% – 5.75% in December, before slowly starting to reduce rates sometime in 2024. Additionally, instability in the commercial real estate sectors, slowing consumer demand, and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to pose risks to the economy.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the forecast projects that <strong>state revenue growth is expected to increase by $191 million in the 2023-25 biennium and increase by $579 million for the 2025-27 biennium compared to the September forecast. </strong></p>
<p>As noted, these numbers represent an improvement over the previous forecast. While growth remains slow, the projected increases are driven by the continued strength of the job market, both nationally and at the state level. Washington’s unemployment rate for October was at 3.8%, a slight increase from the all-time Washington state low of 3.6% seen in September.</p>
<p><strong>More background on the state revenue forecasts can be accessed </strong><a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2019/10/23/what-is-the-revenue-forecast/">on our website</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Near General Fund-State</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the total preliminary and projected Near General Fund-State (GF-S) revenue for each biennium.</p>
<ul>
<li>$66.88 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, 3.3% over the expected 2021-23 biennium.</li>
<li>$71.51 billion for the 2025-27 biennium, 6.9% over the expected 2023-25 biennium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context behind the numbers for Near GF-S accounts from which the University receives funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasted revenue dedicated to the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA) has increased by $5 million for both the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia. <strong>Forecasted WEIA revenue is now $843 million for the 2023-25 biennium and $879 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
<li>The forecast of Education Legacy Trust Account (ELTA) revenue was increased by $6 million in the 2023-25 biennium and $59 million in the 2025-27 biennium. <strong>Forecasted ELTA revenue is now $2.14 billion for the 2023-25 biennium and $2.37 billion for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Governor Inslee will use this forecast as the basis for his proposed 2024 supplemental budgets, which are expected to be released in December. Stay tuned to the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/opb-blog/">OPBlog</a> for updates on these proposals, as well as the 2024 legislative session, which begins on January 8.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) released its September <a href="/erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/meetings/rev20230926_1.pdf">revenue forecast</a> on Tuesday, September 26, 2023. Revenue projections were again revised upward for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia, as well as for the 2021-23 biennium that ended on June 30.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2023/06/28/june-revenue-forecast-projections-revised-slightly-upward-for-upcoming-biennium-despite-slowing-growth/">June</a>, we highlighted that experts expected revenue to increase slightly over the March projection for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia, though the forecast was still lower than what had been predicted last <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2022/11/22/november-revenue-forecast-reports-increased-projections-for-the-current-and-upcoming-biennia-while-economic-growth-continues-to-slow/">November</a>. This change upward was driven by stronger than expected capital gains tax collections, slightly higher construction activity and sales and use tax collections, and the continued strength of the job market.</p>
<p>The September forecast notes that the Seattle-area consumer price inflation continued to exceed the national average, with the seasonally adjusted CPI rising 5.4% compared to the 3.7% increase in the U.S. City Average index. Given the continued high rate of inflation, the forecast assumes the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to a range of 5.5% – 5.75% in November, before starting to reduce rates sometime in 2024. Additionally, the potential for a federal government shutdown, instability in the banking and commercial real estate sectors, the resumption of student loan repayments, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine continue to pose risks to the economy.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the forecast projects that <strong>state revenue growth is expected to increase by $663 million in the 2023-25 biennium and increase by $437 million for the 2025-27 biennium compared to the June forecast. Additionally, revenue for the just concluded 2021-23 biennium increased by $265 million. </strong></p>
<p>As noted, these numbers represent an improvement over the previous forecast. While growth is slowing, the projected increases are driven by the continued strength of the job market, both nationally and at the state level. Washington’s unemployment rate for August remained at 3.6%, an all-time low.</p>

<p><strong>Near General Fund-State</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the total preliminary and projected Near General Fund-State (GF-S) revenue for each biennium. These numbers are now similar to those projected last November before the decline forecasted in <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2023/03/22/march-revenue-forecast-projections-revised-downward-for-upcoming-biennium/">March</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>$64.75 billion for the 2021-23 biennium, 21.9% over the 2019-21 biennium.</li>
<li>$66.69 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, 3.0% over the expected 2021-23 biennium.</li>
<li>$70.93 billion for the 2025-27 biennium, 6.3% over the expected 2023-25 biennium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context behind the numbers for Near GF-S accounts from which the University receives funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasted revenue dedicated to the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA) has increased by $13 million in the 2021-23 biennium, $28 million in the 2023-25 biennium, and $31 million in the 2025-27 biennium. <strong>Forecasted WEIA revenue is now $779 million for the 2021-23 biennium, $838 million for the 2023-25 biennium, and $874 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
<li>The forecast of Education Legacy Trust Account (ELTA) revenue was increased by $141 million in the 2021-23 biennium. <strong>Forecasted ELTA revenue is now over $2.57 billion for the 2021-23 biennium, $2.14 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, and $2.31 billion for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The next state revenue forecast will be released in November, which the Governor will use as a basis for his proposed 2024 supplemental budgets. Stay tuned to the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/opb-blog/">OPBlog</a> for updates as we prepare for the 2024 legislative session.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) released its June <a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/rev20230627.pdf">revenue forecast</a> on Tuesday, June 27, 2023. Revenue projections have been revised slightly upward for the current biennium as well as for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2023/03/22/march-revenue-forecast-projections-revised-downward-for-upcoming-biennium/">March</a>, we highlighted that experts expected revenue to decrease over previous projections for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia. This prediction was based on continued high inflation and interest rates, recent bank failures and tech sector layoffs, uncertainty about the federal debt ceiling, and the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The June forecast notes that the Seattle-area consumer price inflation continued to exceed the national average, with the seasonally adjusted CPI rising 7.0% compared to the 5.0% increase in the U.S. City Average index. Given the continued high rate of inflation, the forecast assumes the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to a range of 5.25% – 5.5% by July 2023. However, there is some uncertainty regarding this assumption, as the Federal Reserve chose not to raise interest rates at its June meeting. Additionally, technology sector layoffs, concerns about bank instability, and the Ukraine-Russia conflict continue to pose risks to the economy.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the forecast projects that <strong>state revenue growth will increase by $341 million in the 2021-23 biennium over the March forecast. Revenue is then expected to increase by $327 million in the 2023-25 biennium and increase by $147 million for the 2025-27 biennium. </strong>While these numbers represent an improvement over the previous forecast, they are still lower than what had been predicted last <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2022/11/22/november-revenue-forecast-reports-increased-projections-for-the-current-and-upcoming-biennia-while-economic-growth-continues-to-slow/">November</a>.</p>
<p>The changes from the March forecast are driven by stronger than expected capital gains tax collections. Construction activity and sales and use tax collections were also slightly stronger than anticipated. In addition, other positive economic trends included the growing job market as well as Washington car and truck sales, which reached a two-year high in May.</p>

<p><strong>Near General Fund-State</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the total preliminary and projected Near General Fund-State (GF-S) revenue for each biennium.</p>
<ul>
<li>$64.49 billion for the 2021-23 biennium, 21.4% over the 2019-21 biennium.</li>
<li>$66.03 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, 2.4% over the expected 2021-23 biennium.</li>
<li>$70.49 billion for the 2025-27 biennium, 6.8% over the expected 2023-25 biennium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context behind the numbers for Near GF-S accounts from which the University receives funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasted revenue dedicated to the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA) has increased by $17 million in the 2021-23 biennium, $25 million in the 2023-25 biennium, and $11 million in the 2025-27 biennium. <strong>Forecasted WEIA revenue is now $766 million for the 2021-23 biennium, $809 million for the 2023-25 biennium, and $844 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
<li>The forecast of Education Legacy Trust Account (ELTA) revenue was increased by $311 million in the 2021-23 biennium. <strong>Forecasted ELTA revenue is now over $2.43 billion for the 2021-23 biennium, $2.12 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, and $2.31 billion for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) released its March<a href="https://erfc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/meetings/rev20230320.pdf"> revenue forecast</a> on Monday, March 20, 2023. In November, we highlighted revenue projections for the 2023-25 biennium and summarized experts’ cautions regarding slowing economic growth. These concerns were associated with rising inflation and interest rates, in addition to geopolitical factors including the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>This month, the forecast projects slowing growth for the remainder of the current biennium with revenue projections revised downward for the 2023-25 and 2025-27 biennia. The Seattle-area consumer price inflation continued to exceed the national average, with the seasonally adjusted CPI rising 8.1% compared to the 6.0% increase in the U.S. City Average index. Given the continued high rate of inflation, the forecast assumes the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to a range of 5.25% – 5.5% by June 2023. However, there is uncertainty regarding this assumption, as the Federal Reserve may choose to delay or reduce any rate hikes given the recent bank failures. Additionally, technology sector layoffs,  debate over raising the federal debt ceiling, and the Ukraine-Russia conflict continue to pose significant risks to the economy.</p>
<p>Given these challenges, the forecast projects that <strong>state revenue growth will continue to slow, increasing by only $194 million in the 2021-23 biennium over the November forecast. Revenue is then expected to decrease by $483 million in the 2023-25 biennium and decrease by $541 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></p>
<p>The changes from the previous forecast are driven by recent Real Estate Excise Tax (REET) collections, which were much lower than anticipated due to rising mortgage rates and slowing construction activity. Additionally, Revenue Act collections, which include the state sales tax and business and occupation tax, are slowing as is the growth in personal income.</p>
<p>The forecast does note some positive economic trends, including the continued strength of the job market as well as relatively strong revenue collections outside REET and the retail sector.</p>
<p><strong>More background on the state revenue forecasts can be accessed <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/2019/10/23/what-is-the-revenue-forecast/">on our website</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Near General Fund-State</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the total preliminary and projected Near General Fund-State (GF-S) revenue for each biennium. Though the forecast has been revised downward, overall revenue is still projected to grow each biennium.</p>
<ul>
<li>$64.15 billion for the 2021-23 biennium, 20.7% over the 2019-21 biennium.</li>
<li>$65.70 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, 2.4% over the expected 2021-23 biennium.</li>
<li>$70.34 billion for the 2025-27 biennium, 7.1% over the expected 2023-25 biennium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context behind the numbers for Near GF-S accounts from which the University receives funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasted revenue dedicated to the Workforce Education Investment Account (WEIA) has decreased by $3 million in the 2021-23 biennium, $9 million in the 2023-25 biennium, and $11 million in the 2025-27 biennium. <strong>Forecasted WEIA revenue is now $748 million for the 2021-23 biennium, $784 million for the 2023-25 biennium, and $833 million for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
<li>The forecast of Education Legacy Trust Account (ELTA) revenue was increased by $74 million in the 2021-23 biennium. <strong>Forecasted ELTA revenue is now over $2.12 billion for the 2021-23 biennium, $2.01 billion for the 2023-25 biennium, and $2.29 billion for the 2025-27 biennium.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This latest revenue forecast was released as the Washington State House of Representatives and Senate prepare to release their proposed operating, capital, and transportation budgets for the 2023-25 biennium. These are all expected to be released by the end of March, with final compromise budgets approved by the end of the legislative session on or before April 23.</p>
<p>The next state revenue forecast will be released in June 2023. Stay tuned to the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/opb-blog/">OPBlog</a> for updates on the 2023 legislative session and the upcoming 2023-25 state budget.</p>
