					<description><![CDATA[It has been many years since I was the first in my family go to college and earn my bachelor’s degree. And to this day, I am still awed by the transformative power of a college degree to change lives. In fact, my college acceptance letter hangs on the wall above my desk as a reminder of this. Higher education opened doors to a career I never knew existed and set me on a path I couldn’t have imagined.  Friday,...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a biochemist, which means that I know more about biochemistry than the average person. In reality, I know quite a lot about a small subfield of biochemistry – yeast prions, which I have spent my entire independent career researching. Even so, every time I read a new publication or see a new result from my laboratory, I appreciate, and am humbled by, how much more there is to learn. Such is the motivation for an academic life, isn’t...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the joys of an academic career is the freedom to explore what intrigues us. We have the agency to become experts in the fields of our own choosing, to self-direct our collaborations, discoveries, innovations, and creations and to follow a line of inquiry wherever it leads. We also have the unparalleled privilege to continuously integrate our knowledge and perspectives with those of our students through our partnership with them in teaching and learning, as both instructors and mentors....]]></description>

Our vision is to create a challenging learning environment for our students that is informed by cutting-edge scholarship. Key to that vision is engaging our students as active participants in their own learning.  In fact, this idea is clearly stated in the...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a full professor and a department chair before it occurred to me to tell anyone my own story. One day, several years ago, I met with a first-generation college student who was also a first-generation American citizen. She had just won our department’s top academic award and expressed her perception that she wasn’t “good enough” to continue on to graduate or medical school. During this conversation, she specifically pointed to me as an example of “what it took.”...]]></description>
